The current record, 90,700 vehicles, was set during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDocuments viewed by Business Insider suggest Tesla did not meet Musks goal in the weeks after he sent the email.\nRead more: Its been 100 years since weve seen anybody like Elon Musk — heres why thats so disorienting\nAccording to documents that describe the daily output rate for one segment of Model 3 production in Fremont, California, output reached at least 1,000 units per day just once in the weeks following Musks May 22 email. During that period, the average output for that segment was about 700 units per day.\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nDaily output rates for one part of the production process do not necessarily correspond with final production numbers on a given day because vehicles must go through other steps that may operate at different speeds. But output for one production segment gives a sense of the upper limit for the entire production process, since each vehicle must go through certain steps before final assembly.\nAn increase in daily production rates during the final weeks of June would not be unprecedented. Tesla made more than 5,000 Model 3s in one week for the first time at the end of the second quarter in 2018 but averaged around 2,200 Model 3s per week during the entire quarter. During the third quarter of 2018, the company made 5,300 Model 3s during the final week while averaging about 4,100 per week.\nOn June 11, during Teslas annual shareholder meeting, Musk said the company had a \"decent shot\" of breaking its quarterly delivery record. The internal documents indicate that Tesla will have to increase Model 3 production rates during the final weeks of June to do so, based on the criterion Musk described in his May 22 email.\nTeslas second-quarter delivery numbers will face particularly intense scrutiny because the companys first-quarter deliveries fell well below those of the prior quarter. Some analysts said the disappointing first-quarter numbers suggested a decrease in demand for Teslas vehicles, but the company blamed logistical challenges related to international deliveries and seasonal trends.\nStrong second-quarter delivery numbers, even if they dont set a company record, could restore confidence in the demand for Teslas vehicles and help push the company back to profitability. (Tesla estimates it will be profitable in the third quarter but not in the second.)\nWeak delivery numbers could intensify concerns about demand and the companys chances of achieving consistent profitability. Tesla has produced four profitable quarters in its 16-year history, including two in the second half of 2018, when delivery numbers reached record highs .\nHave you worked for Tesla?

Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, pushed back against criticism over his involvement in including the provision to gain his support for the budget while also running a business that advertises itself as a seller of Tesla parts and salvaged Tesla electric vehicles.\n\"They called into question my integrity based on half-truths that were spun together most likely by those who oppose allowing Tesla to sell in this state,\" Kapenga said at a news conference.\nTo get the vote of Kapenga , Assembly Republicans added a provision to the budget Tuesday that would allow Tesla to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers rather than having to go through dealers as other car companies must.\nKapenga owns Integrity Motorsports of Eagle. An accountant, Kapenga said the car business is a hobby and he would not gain financially from the measure that would allow Tesla to sell cars more easily in Wisconsin.\nHe choked back tears during the Wednesday news conference, arguing the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story on his ties to Tesla impugned his character.\n\"Just remember as reporters what you say not only impacts the senator it impacts me as a dad ... what you say in the press does impact peoples lives,\" he said.\nKapenga said he asked to put the Tesla provision in the budget but on its own it was not \"material enough\" to get him to support the spending plan. He said he struggled with whether to support the budget but ultimately decided he would back it because of several elements.\nKapengas vote was crucial to passing the budget. Republicans control the Senate 19-14, but two of their members — David Craig of Big Bend and Steve Nass of Whitewater — were on record as no votes. That left no room for error because all Democrats were against it.\nWISCONSINEYE: Watch Sen. Chris Kapengas full news conference\n\"I cannot recall a governor who traveled this state and sat in folding chairs in veterans and American Legions and schools and libraries — hed pull out a folding chair next to an individual and listened,\" Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, said about listening sessions held by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers before introducing his budget proposal that was largely rewritten by Republicans.\n\"This is a budget that will be known for missed opportunities,\" she said.\nBut Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald defended Republicans decision to eliminate many of Evers key proposals, namely expanding Medicaid by tapping into $1 billion of federal funds.\n\"I still think this is the most measured, appropriate response to making sure Wisconsinites have access to health care,\" Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, said. \"Not to mention theres $22 trillion in federal debt, which some people care about and others dont care about at all. But its another thing that I think is in the back of some peoples minds. Is federal money free? Is it our money if its being borrowed?\"\nSen. Bob Wirch, D-Somers, said Republican lawmakers dont have similar concerns about accepting federal money for roads or schools.\n\"Its only when poor people are involved,\" he said.\nThe Assembly passed the budget , 60-39, late Tuesday, with three Republicans joining all Democrats to oppose it.\nThe Republicans voting no were Reps. Janel Brandtjen of Menomonee Falls, Rick Gundrum of Slinger and Timothy Ramthun of Campbellsport.\nThe spending plan now goes to Evers, who can rewrite it using extensive veto powers that allow him to strike out any words or numbers in it.\nThe new budget cycle begins July 1. State operations will continue at current funding levels if Evers doesnt sign the budget by then.\nThe $81.5 billion, two-year budget, when paired with other legislation the Senate plans to pass Wednesday, would reduce income taxes on average by $75 per person in 2019 and by $136 in 2020. Evers wanted a deeper income tax cut — $216 per person on average — but also wanted to raise taxes on manufacturers and capital gains.\nThe Republican budget increases the annual registration fee by $10 for cars (from $75 to $85) and $25 for many light trucks (from $75 to $100).\nIt also boosts the title fee when buying a vehicle by $95, from $69.50 to $164.50. It would not raise the gas tax, as Evers recommended.\nThe GOP budget puts $588 million in new state funding toward health care programs over the next two years. The Republicans rejected Evers plan to take an additional $1 billion in federal funds through the Affordable Care Act to further expand health care programs and free up $324 million in state money.\nThe Republican plan provides a $500 million increase in state funding for K-12 schools, about a third of what Evers sought.\nThe state for years has fallen short of providing two-thirds funding for schools. Republicans said they would get the state to that threshold, but their version of the budget again came shy of that, getting to about 65% for the school year that starts this fall.\nTheir budget  gives an additional $58 million to University of Wisconsin schools, about half of what Evers wanted.\nThe budget keeps in place a freeze on in-state tuition that has been in place since 2013. Evers also supports the freeze.\nProperty taxes on the median-valued home would go up $55 for 2019 and $45 for 2020 under the GOP budget. Thats just below the levels in Evers budget.\nDelay for closing teen prison\nSenate lawmakers on Wednesday also passed a number of bills, including one that would push back the closure of the states youth prison.\nUnder a law passed last year , the state is to close Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls by Jan. 1, 2021. The prison complex north of Wausau has been the subject of multiple lawsuits, including three that resulted in nearly $5 million of settlements last week.\nThe facility was also at the center of a long-running criminal probe that ended without charges in April.\nAssembly Bill 188 gives the Evers administration six more months — until July 1, 2021 — to close Lincoln Hills. Evers has said he needs even more time and that meeting the new deadline may be “ physically impossible ” because new county and state lockups must be built to house teen offenders.\nThe Assembly approved the legislation to delay the closure of Lincoln Hills on a voice vote last week. This bill and others Senate lawmakers approved Wednesday now go to Evers for final approval.\nTaxes\nWisconsin and many other states expanded the collection of sales taxes for online purchases last year after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for doing so.\nAssembly Bill 251 would use the additional sales tax revenue to bring down the two lowest income tax brackets. When combined with income tax cuts in the budget, the average tax filer would see a $75 cut in income taxes this year and a $136 cut in 2020.\nThe bill would also require online marketplaces such as Amazon and Airbnb to collect sales taxes on behalf of those who sell products and services on their platforms.\nHighways\nSenate lawmakers also passed four bills that are meant to alter how the state builds roads.\nAssembly Bill 273 would require the DOT to maintain a list of material contractors can use to build roads, which is meant to help contractors submit bids that are as low as possible.\nAssembly Bill 275 would require the state to maintain a list of highway projects that could be designed and constructed by the same firm.\nThe DOT doesn’t allow contractors to do both, but the budget would give DOT the authority to allow that to happen. Assembly Bill 275 would make sure the state would have at the ready a group of projects that could be built using that process, known as design-build.\nSupporters of the idea say roads and bridges often can be built faster and cheaper if one company handles an entire project. Opponents say that process doesnt provide enough protections and limits competition because only large firms can offer bids that cover both engineering and construction.\nAssembly Bill 284 would require the DOT to set up a system for giving bonuses to employees who find ways to generate savings or efficiencies.\nYou can find out who your legislators are and how to contact them here: https://maps.legis.wisconsin.gov/\nContact Patrick Marley and Molly Beck at patrick.marley@jrn.com and molly.beck@jrn.com.\nDo Not Sell / Share / Target My Info\nCookie Settings\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-26'),

However, led by Musk’s near-term delivery promises, shares have bounced back lately. June so far has been the best month since October for Tesla stock.\nTamberrino expects the downward spiral for shares to resume as it becomes more clear that sustainable demand for Tesla’s products are below expectations.\nShares of the company were marginally down at $226.10 in early trading.\nTwelve of 31 brokerages covering the stock rate it “buy” or higher, 7 “hold” and 12 “sell” or lower, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\nReporting by Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-20'),

The battery pack and battery cells are the main cost component in an electric vehicle, according to research by IHS Markit.\nThe company has been \"battery-constrained\" in the past, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged at the companys annual shareholders meeting earlier in June. That means a lack of batteries limited Teslas production and sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems (Powerwalls and Powerpacks).\nMaking its own battery cells would also fit with Musks general ambition to make Tesla as \"vertically integrated\" as possible, which means developing, manufacturing and selling everything it can — even its own enterprise software.\nBut manufacturing cells at high volume would be another challenge for a company that recently implemented cost-cutting measures and is still struggling to perfect its high-volume vehicle production.\nTesla and Panasonic did not respond to requests for comment.\nSkunkworks lab on Kato road\nTesla employees conduct some of their battery cell manufacturing research at a \"skunkworks lab\" at the companys Kato Road facility, a few minutes from its car plant in Fremont, California.\nThat plant is where Tesla makes its Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles today, while its batteries are made at the Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, a factory jointly owned and operated with Panasonic.\nEmployees in Teslas battery R&D teams are now focused on designing and prototyping advanced lithium ion battery cells, as well as new equipment and processes that could allow Tesla to produce cells in high volumes, employees and former employees said.\nTesla has posted job listings in the last month for various engineers involved in battery cell design, equipment for producing battery cells and manufacturing processes to make batteries.\nEven if Teslas effort to start making battery cells is successful, the company is not likely to cut ties with Panasonic and other battery suppliers any time soon.\nTesla employees familiar with cell supplier negotiations said the company is most likely to work with Panasonic and LG to provide the cells that go into the initial Model 3 vehicles produced in its Shanghai factory. That factory could start production by the end of 2019, with mass production beginning in 2020.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at the ground breaking for the automakers new factory in Shanghai.\nEunice Yoon | CNBC\nThe ambition to bring at least some battery cell manufacturing in house has been broadly discussed within Tesla and among its followers.\nAt the companys annual shareholder meeting in June, Musk invited Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel and Vice President of Technology Drew Baglino on stage to tell shareholders about battery-related initiatives at Tesla.\nMusk encouraged outside investors to focus on two strategic matters at Tesla: How quickly the company can offer completely self-driving vehicles, and its plan to \"scale battery production and get the cost per kilowatt hour lower.\" He said Tesla wasnt ready to let the \"cat out of the bag\" yet and would reveal further details — including about the companys acquisition of Maxwell Technologies , completed in May this year — at an investor battery and powertrain day before the end of 2019.\nJB Straubel, Tesla Motors former chief technical officer, speaks during a ribbon cutting for a new Supercharger station outside of the Tesla Factory on August 16, 2013 in Fremont, California.\nJustin Sullivan | Getty Images\nStraubel said: \"Its more obvious now than I think it ever was, we need a large-scale solution to cell production.\"\nBaglino added, \"Were not sitting idly by. Were taking all the moves required to be masters of our own destiny here, technologically and otherwise. I think through all the experience weve developed with partners and otherwise, we will have solutions for this.\"\nExecutives comments on Tesla battery tech follow reports about tension between the company and Panasonic.\nIn January, Panasonic struck a deal with Toyota to build car batteries together through a joint venture thats majority owned by Toyota. In early April, Panasonic said it would temporarily freeze its investments in Tesla Gigafactories.\nA few days later, Musk blamed Panasonic for dragging down the pace of Model 3 production, saying its cell lines were operating at only two-thirds of their capacity, or 24 GWh, at their shared Gigafactory. \"Tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical,\" Musk tweeted.\nTweet here\nIn recent weeks, following layoffs and other cost-cutting efforts by Tesla, Panasonic has hired a number of former Tesla employees at the Gigafactory in Nevada, including technicians, supervisors, and process and systems engineers, according to LinkedIn profiles and current and recent Tesla employees.\nHopping from Tesla to Panasonic at the Gigafactory wasnt as common just a couple of years ago, according to a former Tesla human resources employee who asked to remain unnamed.

Musk has repeatedly pointed out that batteries are a primary constraint when it comes to Tesla’s ability to produce not only is cars, but also its home power products like the Powerwall consumer domestic battery for solar energy systems.\nPer the CNBC report, Tesla is doing its battery research at an experimental lab near its factory in Fremont, at a property it maintains on Kato road. Tesla would need lots more time and effort to turn its battery ambitions into production at the scale it requires, however, so don’t expect it to replace Panasonic anytime soon.

That relationship extends out to Teslas Buffalo, New York-based solar panel factory, which Tesla also co-owns with Panasonic. But recently, the fraternity between the two companies seems to be wearing thin.\nIn September of last year, a Panasonic executive said that the bottleneck for Model 3 production had been the speed at which Panasonic could manufacture battery cells . In October 2018, Panasonic reported that it lost $65 million to the part of its business that makes battery cells for Teslas vehicles. In April 2019, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Panasonic would not make additional investments into Teslas Gigafactory beyond what it had already committed to. Teslas recent purchase of Maxwell Technologies , which makes automotive- and utility-grade battery components, may also have driven a wedge between the companies.\nAdvertisement\nArs contacted Tesla for comment, but we have not received a response.\nTesla is currently building out a factory in Shanghai, and it has not partnered with Panasonic exclusively to supply battery cells to that location, though Panasonic or another major manufacturer of battery cells will, in all likelihood, supply the Shanghai factory in the near term.

And Tesla did actually launch its $35,000 Model 3 though it did come with some consequences .\nHowever, we expect that things will ramp up for Tesla during the second half of 2019 with a series of increasingly more exciting announcements starting with…\nTesla Model S and Model X Refresh\nWe have already seen a partial refresh of Tesla’s flagship sedan and SUV earlier this year with a motor and suspension upgrade , but we expect something bigger to be released in a few months.\nIt will mainly consist of an interior design refresh, which we have been talking about for a year now.\nIn July of last year, we reported that Tesla is planning a significant interior refresh for Model S and Model X and we even leaked the first design drawings:\nAs seen in the images above, Tesla plans to bring to Model S and Model X a similar interior design as currently found in Model 3 but with an extra screen and more “premium materials.”\nAt the time, we were told that Tesla was planning to release the new interior early in the third quarter 2019 – although plans might have changed since last year.\nWhile Tesla introduced a new exterior for Model S and Model X in 2016, the interior design of those vehicles has only received minor incremental improvements since launching the Model S back in 2012.\nIt would make a new interior long overdue, but it is also expected not to be the only significant change introduced to the lineup by the end of the year.\nTesla’s Own New Battery Technology with Maxwell\nWe expect Tesla to introduce a new battery technology, probably starting with Model S and Model X, by the end of the year.\nT esla’s recent acquisition of Maxwell and its dry electrode technology is a clear indicator that the automaker is upgrading its battery chemistry, but we are also expecting an announcement about Tesla making its own battery cells.\nWe have recently analyzed a conversation between CEO Elon Musk, CTO JB Straubel, and VP of Technology Drew Baglino about Tesla’s battery technology and we concluded that the automaker all but confirmed that they aim to introduce a plan to produce their own battery cells with Maxwell’s technology .\nThe new battery cells should result in lower cost, more volume, higher energy density, and even better longevity.\nWe have high expectations for the new technology and we expect the details to be announced by the end of the year at Tesla’s Battery and Powertrain Investor Day, which currently doesn’t have an official date.\nTesla Pickup Truck\nThis one is not as much of a “surprise” since Tesla has been guiding the unveiling of its pickup truck for “this summer” or “by the end of the year” for a while now, but the truck itself is apparently going to be surprising.\nMusk has been talking about a futuristic design and everyone is struggling to figure out what it will look like.\nWe recently shared a bunch of renderings and drawings of Tesla’s Pickup truck based on new information about the official teaser:\nOn top of the design, we are expecting some incredible specs following comments from Musk about the truck.\nTesla is expected to unveil the truck during the second half of 2019.\nTesla Insurance\nMusk has been promising a new Tesla insurance program to launch in the next few months.\nTwo years ago, we published an exclusive report revealing that Tesla was working on a new car insurance program, which it started offering to its customers in Australia and Hong Kong. It has since expanded into several other markets including North America .\nBut we learned earlier this year that it was only a first step toward building Tesla’s own insurance products and the automaker is aiming to soon release a “more compelling product.”\nIt was originally supposed to launch last month, but Musk said that they need to complete an undisclosed acquisition before they can launch the insurance product.\nTesla has been applying for regulatory approval of the product and it is expected to launch in the coming months.\nMaybe More\nThere could be some more surprises before the end of the year, but it would already be a pretty full year for Tesla in terms of product announcements either way.\nIf Tesla was to announce something else by the end of the year, what do you think it would be?

Her inventions are clever, the robots intentionally excessive and comically inept. Hilarity ensues; Giertz curses, to the chagrin of her advertisers . But she keeps churning out machines as well as videos, exploring a variety of building projects in her San Francisco workshop—even as she battles a brain tumor .\nWhich makes Giertz’s newest project even more remarkable—and functional. It marks a kind of turning point for Giertz, who says she’d like to focus more on building cars, and not the shitty kind. Today, she revealed an electric pickup truck she calls Truckla . It’s a heavily modified Tesla Model 3 and, as Giertz’s stylized promotional video states, it’s available exactly nowhere. Only Giertz will drive it, but she insists it is indeed drivable. (She’s also publishing a 31-minute video detailing how she built it.)\n“This is going to be my daily car, which in some ways is fucking stupid,” Giertz says.\nPhotograph: Simone Giertz\nGiertz, who’s Swedish, says the EV pickup truck has been a dream of hers ever since she got her US driver’s license a couple of years ago. Elon Musk has been working on an official version: Last week, the Tesla CEO said the “cyberpunk truck” will make its official debut “probably some time towards the end of summer,” though the man isn’t much for hitting deadlines. Giertz decided not to wait. If there was ever a subtweet, going out and building the thing before Elon Musk managed to might just be the ultimate.\nAround this time last year, Giertz partnered with a friend, engineer Marcos Ramirez, to start sketching out what a Model 3-turned-pickup-truck would look like. Two other YouTubers, Laura Kampf and Rich Rebuilds, got involved. Other friends and family pitched in on the project in exchange for “high fives and food,” Giertz says. Their initial goal was to launch Truckla by the fall of 2018.\nLauren Goode is a senior writer at WIRED who covers consumer technology.\nThen Giertz’s noncancerous brain tumor returned, after it was previously removed through surgery. She underwent several weeks of radiation therapy early in 2019, some of which she has vlogged about on YouTube and Patreon. During that time, she continued to work on both “Shitty Robots” and the Truckla.\n“One of the initial designs we had was to essentially strip everything from the midway and back, and just put in a flatbed,” Giertz says. “There are a lot of trucks that look like that, with a chassis up front and then a bare bones flatbed. But I didn’t like the look of that. So we decided to salvage as much of the back half as possible and try to build it into more of an El Camino pickup truck.”\nThe Truckla is “usable now, but fully drivable in July.”\nSimone Giertz\nGiertz says the EV made for an easier conversion than an internal combustion engine-powered car, because the battery adds structural integrity. The team did have to add some reinforcement to the beams at the top of the truck, which will allow it to hold together and “not, just, taco,” Giertz says. “I mean, I love tacos, but a Tesla taco would not be the best investment.” She plans to do some additional waterproofing to protect the battery pack. The Truckla is “usable now, but fully drivable in July,” Giertz says.\n“This is going to be my daily car, which in some ways is fucking stupid,” Giertz says. Her other ride, which she refers to as Cheese Louise, is a yellow Sebring-Vanguard Citicar , and is easily recognized. “I said, the next car I get, I need to get a very anonymous car like a Prius, so I can park it outside of my house and workshop,” she says.\n“And then I realized, this is not that car.”\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-18'),

See our ethics statement.\nTesla is pulling its secret video game features out of the shadows and bringing them front and center starting today as Tesla Arcade , a new game hub found across its line of electric vehicles. And earlier this afternoon, the company brought a Model 3 to downtown San Francisco to let The Verge try out Arcade and its newest title, developer Vector Unit’s Beach Buggy Racing 2. It’s an iOS and Android racing game you can play on a phone or tablet, but what makes it special on a Tesla car is its controller: the literal steering wheel of the Model 3.\nTesla has always prided itself on treating its electric vehicles like computers, and it often touts the ability to send game-changing, over-the-air updates to its cars that add everything from improved self-driving capabilities to silly Easter eggs like “James Bond mode.” Now, Tesla is going one step further and turning its cars into full-blown video game consoles.\nWith this new update, you’ll get Beach Buggy Racing 2 alongside some existing Atari classics . Tesla is also promising support for Studio MDHR’s cartoony platformer Cuphead in the coming months, which will work with gamepad support that Tesla already rolled out. The update also makes these gaming features easier to find. Previously, they were hidden inside a special menu accessible only by pressing the Tesla logo from the main hub of the infotainment center and finding a secret drawer of sorts for Easter eggs. Now, Tesla Arcade is found by pressing an arrow icon found at the bottom of the home screen’s main icons, which opens a dedicated menu bar. From there, you can tap the “Arcade” button and you’ll gain access to the full list of titles right away.\nPhoto by Brennan King / The Verge\nVector Unit worked alongside Tesla engineers to make sure its game could tap into the car’s physical steering and braking system. (Sorry, no gas: Tesla advises you not to press the accelerator while playing the game. Just in case you forget, the software disables the pedal until you exit Arcade and sends you a detailed “Warning” note.) In single-player, you can use the steering wheel or touch controls. I was able to even use both at the same time, steering with one hand and tapping the screen to use in-game power ups and attack items. There’s also two-player mode, in which a passenger can play split-screen alongside you, tapping the screen while you use the steering wheel.\nSteering was surprisingly responsive, mainly because Tesla’s software unlocks the steering wheel from its standard rigidness when in park and lets you freely move it as you would on a toy wheel attached to a racing arcade cabinet. You can also adjust the sensitivity of the steering. That doesn’t change how the wheel feels, but it does make movements of the wheel move your in-game character more dramatically.\nThe Tesla steering controls are surprisingly responsive in Beach Buggy Racing 2\nI found it much more fun to use the steering wheel than the touchscreen controls, and pressing the brake pedal (which, admittedly, I did not do too often) felt like it had a realistic slow-down effect on my car. One other neat touch is that your in-game vehicle is no longer a cartoony car, but the actual model and color of your real-life Tesla, pulled from the in-car software.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk teased this integration back at the E3 video game expo last week , in conversation with Bethesda’s Todd Howard, who’s helping the game studio work with Tesla to port Fallout Shelter to its line of electric cars. But Musk didn’t give a release date for Arcade at the time. Now, the company says the update will be making its way to Tesla cars this week and next, but anyone can try it at a Tesla showroom through June 30th.\nPersonally, I don’t see myself ever really wanting to play mobile games on the screen in my car. But as someone who commutes via bike and hasn’t owned a vehicle since they graduated college, I can say that having a car even remotely capable of playing video games like this is certainly an appealing dream. I can certainly empathize with those who do own Teslas and want to use Tesla Arcade, or are just plain excited about a future where the modern car has as robust an app ecosystem as our smartphones do now.\nA Tesla spokesperson tells The Verge that the idea is to do something fun and unique that can perhaps keep you busy while you’re waiting to pick someone up, or while you’re at a Supercharger station. It helps that the games are indeed fun to play, and that the Model 3 screen is a gorgeous display that rivals the iPad Pro. In that sense, Arcade is yet another feature Tesla owners can show off to their friends, like the litany of Easter eggs that have come before it and more visceral showoff features like the Model S’s Ludicrous Mode.\nFor now, let’s just hope Tesla daredevils don’t try to get their gaming sessions in at stop lights.\nThe Verge on YouTube /\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-18'),

Chris Kapenga, who has pushed for the measure in the past and owns a business that sells Tesla parts and salvaged electric vehicles.\nAssembly Republicans added the measure to the budget Tuesday , a day before the GOP-controlled Senate was to take it up. Kapenga is a longtime supporter of the Tesla proposal but said he wasnt sure yet if he would vote for the budget.\nThe budget measure would allow Tesla to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers rather than having to go through dealers.\nKapenga, a Republican from Delafield who works as an accountant, owns Integrity Motorsports of Eagle , which sells Tesla parts and rebuilds and sells salvaged Teslas, according to the company website. A 2019 Tesla Model X sells at prices ranging from $83,000 to $139,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\nKapenga said in an interview he hasnt sold any Tesla vehicles but has rebuilt two for him and his wife. Kapenga said he previously sold used Lexus-made vehicles through the business.\n\"Ive made no money from it,\" Kapenga said. \"Its a hobby of mine and just because I enjoy the product and that I’m kind of a gear head, I dont gain materially or economically at all — that would be unethical ... Im very careful of that.\"\nKapenga previously supported legislation that mirrors the late addition to the budget. He said he purchased his first Tesla about a year ago after he began sponsoring the legislation.\n\"I learned about Tesla after I decided to sponsor the bill,\" he said. \"It was fascinating. ... Its been a total blast.\"\nDemocratic Rep. Evan Goyke of Milwaukee questioned Kapenga naming his business Integrity Motorsports.\n\"Conflict of Interest Motorsports?\" said Goyke, who sits on the Legislatures budget committee.\n\"If this is above board and if there are no problems, then why not do it in the light of day? Why try to sneak it in? To me, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. To me its problematic and I hope he doesn’t get away with it.\"\nGOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of Rochester said he didnt see any conflict for Kapenga.\n\"If you can already do your business (under existing law), whats the difference?\" Vos said.\nGetting Kapengas vote is essential for Republicans.\nRepublicans control the Senate 19-14. Two Republicans — Steve Nass of Whitewater and David Craig of Big Bend — have said they will vote against the budget, and Republicans cant afford to lose any more because all Democrats oppose it.\nThe Republican-led Assembly was expected to pass the budget Tuesday and Senate leaders plan to take it up Wednesday. It would then go to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who can reshape it using partial vetoes.\nThe Tesla tweak was just one of a number of provisions unveiled Tuesday as Republicans tried to lock down the last votes needed to pass the $81.5 billion budget in the Assembly and Senate.\nOther new provisions would give counties more prosecutors and prevent a committee of lawmakers from imposing new vehicle fees on its own.\nAssembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke of Kaukauna said Tesla vehicles should be sold differently from other cars because they are part of \"market disruptions\" that are akin to other new technologies. He said he didnt know Kapenga sold Tesla parts.\n\"I dont know anything about his business interests,\" Steineke said. \"Youd have to talk to the senators about that.\"\nContact Mary Spicuzza at (414) 224-2324 or mary.spicuzza@jrn.com .

In 2018, it was Musks compensation that rocketed into outer space. | Chris Carlson / AP\nWASHINGTON (PAI)—Elon Musk is known for pushing non-gasoline-fueled cars. Now he’ll be known for something else: His pay and perks. To be precise, $2,284,044,884 worth of them last year.\nThat was Musk’s payout in 2018, including stock options and other “compensation,” according to the AFL-CIO’s annual Executive Paywatch survey.\nThe data garnered from official federal filings, also featured, for the first time, another figure: The ratio between a CEO’s yearly pay and perks and those available to an average worker in that mogul’s company.\nThe higher the ratio, the greater the gap between the executive and the firm’s workers. Musk leads that category, too. The average worker at Musk’s car company, Tesla, earned $56,163 last year—not very much in the high-cost San Francisco Bay Area where Tesla is located. Musk earned 40,668 times as much.\nThe union federation argues the honchos don’t deserve such high payouts. Exactly 110 executives and CEOs, the figures showed, earned more than $20 million each last year. The CEO of T-Mobile, John Legere, whose firm repeatedly breaks labor law against the Communications Workers’ organizing campaign, was sixth, at $66,538,206. And in a sign of the sexism that prevails even among the capitalist class, only four the 110—the CEOs of Williams-Sonoma, GM, General Dynamics, and Lockheed-Martin—were women.\n“CEO-to-worker pay ratio data is important. A higher ratio could be a sign that companies suffer from a winner-take-all philosophy where executives reap the lion’s share of compensation,” the AFL-CIO said. “A lower ratio could indicate which companies were dedicated to creating high-wage jobs and investing in their employees for the company’s long-term health.”\nMusk’s pay and perks were the extremely high end of a very tilted scale. He garnered nine times as much last year as the #2, Patrick Smith of Axon Enterprises ($246,026,710) and 17.8 times as much as the #3 executive, David Zaslav of Discovery, Inc.—yes, The Discovery Channel. His take: $129,499,005.\nThe average CEO, the federation reported, earned $14.5 million in total compensation, 287 times as much as the average worker. “The imbalance in our economy between the pay of CEOs and working people continues to be a problem,” the AFL-CIO drily commented.\nIt’s an old story, too, federation Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler said in introducing the data.\nThe average U.S. worker got a $1,000 raise last year, she noted. But that’s not enough even to keep up with inflation. That “worker isn’t making enough to cover rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in 15 of the largest cities across the country. Meanwhile, 40% of hourly workers have nothing saved up for an emergency, while 75% have less than $500.\n“We know this equality gap isn’t new. Over the past decade, the average Standard & Poor 500 CEO’s pay increased by more than $5 million, while the average worker only saw an increase of less than $800 a year.\n“Productivity and corporate profits are through the roof, but wages for working people are flat—and staying flat.\n“Bottom line: For too long, corporate greed and rigged economic rules have created a relentlessly growing pay gap between CEOs and the rest of us. It’s why everything from college education to retirement security to gas prices are getting harder and harder for people to afford. We see it every day in communities across the country. And that must change.”\nBut pay isn’t the only gap workers face against the rich. There’s the wealth gap, too—and at least 18 more far-sighted among the super-rich stepped forward the same day to tell all presidential hopefuls: “Tax us more.”\nThe richest, including top Democratic Party giver George Solos and two members of the Pritzker family—a third, J.B., is now the Democratic Illinois governor—said the imbalance of wealth is bad for the country and not just financially.\nAmazon paid less in taxes in 2018 than you paid for your Prime membership. | AP\n“The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans,” their letter said.\n“America has a moral, ethical, and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more. A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms. Instituting a wealth tax is in the interest of our republic,” they stated.\nSeveral of the Democratic hopefuls, notably Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, Ind-Vt., advocate such a wealth tax. National Nurses United has long campaigned for an extra tax on securities and other asset sales, to both raise revenue and to discourage the financial finagling and stock speculation that produced the Great Recession a decade ago.\nBut, as Shuler pointed out, there’s one presidential hopeful who’s gone the other way on taxes: The man in the White House.\nPresident Donald Trump’s “tax cut only made things worse by widening the gap between the 1% and the rest of us,” Shuler said. “The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%, and 60 of the largest U.S. companies paid nothing in federal income taxes last year—despite being profitable. In other words, Amazon users pay more for a Prime membership than Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year.”\nTags:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-27'),

Both men competed for control of the supply for electrical power in the 1880s and 1890s in a widely publicized debate over the safety of AC systems.\n“The Current War” was originally scheduled to be released in 2017 by The Weinstein Company, but was delayed due to the sexual abuse and assault scandal around film producer Harvey Weinstein. The rights to the film were eventually secured by 101 Studios. According to Entertainment Weekly , director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon said that the delay also allowed him to substantially change the original film following early screenings.\nThe film is based heavily on actual historical events and developments in electricity - a scientific legacy rooted heavily in Pennsylvania.\nBenjamin Franklin, the famed Philadelphia founding father, polymath and politician, was renown for his scientific acumen, particularly in the field of electricity. Among his innovations were the labeling of positive and negative charges and the conservation of charge, and perhaps famously, helping to identify lightning as electricity via experiments involving a key and a kite. He also invented the lightning rod to protect buildings from lightning damage.\nOver a century later, in 1882, Thomas Edison was contacted by a group of investors in Shamokin, Pennsylvania . The New Jersey native was already known as the Wizard of Menlo Park for his work creating light bulbs suited for practical use, which were illuminating the nights of Manhattan and competing directly with gas utilities.\nREAD MORE: The 19 greatest things invented in Pennsylvania\nEdison took up residence in Shamokin in 1882 to supervise the construction and implementation of an electrical power station. Soon after, he was also contacted by investors in nearby Sunbury, and in 1883, Sunbury’s City Hotel became the first building in the world to be illuminated by a three-wire electric light system.\nSeveral residences and businesses in Shamokin soon followed suit, and Saint Edwards Catholic Church on Shamokin Street became the first church in the world to be illuminated by electrical lighting.\nMeanwhile, competition for Edison was brewing with the Westinghouse Electric Company, pioneered by Pittsburgh-based inventor George Westinghouse. Having already invented the air brake, the rotary steam engine and the Westinghouse Farm Engine, Westinghouse’s field of interest had expanded to include gas, telephone and electricity utilities, and he began investing heavily in AC-based lighting systems, experimenting with and implementing many such systems in the Pittsburgh area.\nAnd in 1893, Nikola Tesla delivered a speech at Philadelphia’s Franklin Institute, and among the highlights of his lecture he theorized that “the transmission of intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires” would some day be possible. The connection to Franklin’s legacy of electrical knowledge was surely more than a coincidence.\nFor their many achievements, including the ones made in electrical science and engineering, both Benjamin Franklin and George Westinghouse made our list of the 100 Greatest Pennsylvanians of All Time .\n“The Current War” is scheduled for a limited release beginning on Oct. 4, with a nationwide release planned for Oct. 11.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

It deferred to a previous statement made to IndyStar in January 2017:\n“We have been deeply saddened by this accident and have been working closely with authorities to facilitate their report. While it can be difficult to determine the precise speed of a vehicle in such a crash, the observed damage and debris field indicate a very high speed collision.”\nStacey McCarthy, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, is the wife of Kevin McCarthy, who was among the two victims, according to an obituary. McCarthy was the founder and CEO of the Indianapolis company that developed the Case Pacer software, which helps attorneys manage their cases. He is survived by three young children.\nThe other victim, Casey Speckman, was an attorney and worked for McCarthy as a sales representative. She died months before her wedding .\nMcCarthy owned the 2015 Model S vehicle, but he was a passenger in the car at the time of the crash. Speckman was driving, authorities said.\nThe vehicle was heading north on Illinois Street near 16th Street when Speckman lost control and crashed into a tree and parking garage shortly after 1 a.m. on Nov. 3, 2016, authorities said. Speckman, 27, and McCarthy, 44, were killed.\nThe lawsuit says Speckman lost control as she was trying to avoid a wrong-way driver. Witnesses saw the car come to a rest against the wall of the parking garage before bursting into flames, the complaint said.\nMcCarthy could be seen trying to escape the engulfed vehicle after the crash, according to the complaint. But car defects prevented him from getting out safely, the lawsuit alleges.\nAmong the alleged defects are the vehicles \"unstable\" lithium ion batteries, which the complaint says have resulted in fires that have ignited spontaneously or when impacted. The luxury electric sports car is powered by a 1,200-pound battery pack made up of several thousand small lithium batteries, IndyStar previously reported.\nThe complaint says the vehicle sped up to 70 mph from 10 mph seconds before the crash due to an \"uncommanded acceleration event.\"\nIt also alleges \"faulty door handles\" trapped McCarthy in the vehicle after the crash, causing him to burn alive and inhale toxic gases.\nSpeckman, investigators said, died of crash-related injuries with the fire as a contributing factor. The fire killed McCarthy, according to police.\nAuthorities have said drunken-driving was a factor in the crash. Speckmans blood-alcohol level tested at 0.21 percent, according to IMPD investigators and an accident report. McCarthy had a blood-alcohol level that tested at .017 percent, investigators said. The legal limit in Indiana at which a driver is presumed intoxicated is 0.08 percent.\nEarlier that night, Speckman and McCarthy were entertaining clients at the Omni Hotel, according to the lawsuit. After they left, the complaint says, they spoke with a witness who \"observed no outward signs of inebriation or intoxication.\"\nOne of the attorneys in the case, Richard Hailey, told IndyStar that the victims alcohol levels will likely come up in the case. But attorneys believe it was not the cause of the crash.\n\"The (defects) in the complaint would cause this accident with anybody in the car,\" he said. \"These rapid accelerations, the inability to get out of the car, the fires, that’s not a product of alcohol. That’s produced by the way the car is designed and operates.\"\nThe lawsuit says Tesla failed to adequately warn drivers of the dangers created by the alleged defects. It seeks damages from Tesla.\nIndyStar reporter Vic Ryckaert contributed to this report.\nContact IndyStar reporter Crystal Hill at 317-444-6094 or cnhill@gannett.com .

(Credit: Chris Harris/Twitter)\nPosted on\nJune 24, 2019\nThere was once a time when UK-based auto show Top Gear practically ignored the existence of Tesla vehicles on the car market. If the popular motoring program’s recent episode is any indication, that time appears to be long gone. The auto show’s host, Chris Harris, has become somewhat of an EV convert during his time with the all-electric sedan.\nOff the bat, Harris noted that he would try his best to ignore the hype surrounding the Model 3. He stressed the importance of simply reviewing the vehicle the same way he does other cars. For the most part, he did, discussing only the vehicle’s characteristics such as its suite of fun Easter Eggs, its minimalistic interior, and its exterior looks. The Top Gear host was unimpressed with the Model 3’s design, finding the car to be far too “vanilla” for a vehicle that is being considered as an automobile that can change the face of motoring forever.\nBut then, the host quips, perhaps that was the point of the Model 3. Tesla made it a point to ensure that its most disruptive vehicle to date does not shock and awe at face value. Being a great car that just so happens to be electric, Harris noted that the Model 3 does appear to have what it takes to convert people away from the veterans of Europe’s hot high-performance sedan market.\nRemember when @elonmusk boasted his new car, the Model 3, was faster than “anything in its class\"? Well, that was a claim we couldn’t allow to pass unchecked. So, on tonights #TopGear , @harrismonkey assembles the class, and sets about putting Mr Musk’s boasts to the test… pic.twitter.com/OWmv1SkHaE\n— Top Gear (@BBC_TopGear) June 23, 2019\nAnd then came the track test.\nGunning the electric sedan into a track, the host could be seen genuinely enjoying the vehicle. The motiring show opted to test the Model 3 against the best high-performance sedans that Europe can offer: the Mercedez-AMG C 63 S, the BMW M3, and the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. First off was a drag race, an event that the Model 3 would likely dominate.\nIn order to give the vehicle a bigger challenge, the motoring show opted to hold a half-mile race. As the four-way race started, Harris was surprised when the Model 3 just kept pulling , even beyond the quarter-mile mark. The Mercedes-AMG C 63 S did catch the Model 3 a few feet away from the half-mile mark, but even with this result, the Top Gear host was convinced.\n“This is the traffic light king. It’s an AK-47 disguised as a butter knife,” Harris said as he contemplated the results of the half-mile drag race.\nOn Sunday nights #TopGear , @harrismonkey investigates Elon Musks claim that the Tesla Model 3 Performance \"will beat anything in its class on the track\". Tune in Sunday at 8pm on @BBCTwo for the full film pic.twitter.com/gbyyfqsM6T\n— Top Gear (@BBC_TopGear) June 22, 2019\nPerhaps what really convinced Harris was the results of the Model 3’s handling test, which required the vehicle to go around a hastily-assembled course. The Top Gear host previously drove both the M3 and the Giulia Quadrifoglio on the same course, and the Alfa Romeo ended up winning against the BMW . With this in mind, Harris opted to set the time using the powerful petrol sedan. The Alfa Romeo lived up to its reputation, handling the track in a refined manner, and completing the course in 1:04:84.\nThe Top Gear host was not a fan of the Model 3’s handling, stating that the vehicle felt soft around the corners. It was unknown if the electric sedan’s Track Mode was activated during the test, but the Tesla nonetheless attacked the course with such ferocity that Harris was nevertheless impressed. While the Model 3 was not as refined around the corners as the Giulia Quadrifoglio, the vehicle’s insane acceleration was nonetheless enough to complete the course in 1:04:28, a full half-second faster than the Alfa Romeo. Considering that the Model 3 seemed to have only 50+% of its battery during the tests, these figures are nonetheless impressive.\nThe motoring show ended its Tesla segment by concluding that the Model 3 does indeed live up to Elon Musk’s statements. It does beat petrol cars, even around the track. For a show like Top Gear to admit such a thing, is not a bad accomplishment for the Model 3 at all. As for Chris Harris, he recently announced on Twitter that he has decided to buy a Tesla Model 3 for himself.\nSo, I think I’ll be buying a Tesla Model 3 quite soon. Thought it was so impressive. Nothing like as enjoyable as an M3, but as my first toe-dip into the leccy world, it should work until they figure out how to make EVs more fun and desirable.\n— chris harris (@harrismonkey) June 24, 2019\nTesla gets full ‘Top Gear’ treatment, Chris Harris to buy Model 3 ‘soon’ after review\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-24'),

Photo: IC Photo\nA plunge in first-quarter sales, a cut to expected deliveries, a reduction in government subsidies and a couple of cars that burst into flames — 2019 hasn’t been a great year for Nio Inc.\nAnd it doesn’t look like it’s going to get much better anytime soon.\nThe electric-vehicle maker sometimes called China’s answer to Tesla (and sometimes just called a wannabe) began deliveries on Tuesday of its second model, the five-seat ES6 SUV. The milestone, along with a recently announced partnership with a new investor, might leave some wondering if the automaker, whose shares have lost 60% of their value since its initial public offering on Sept. 12, is on the cusp of a turnaround.\nNio’s sales have been rising and China’s electric car market is growing rapidly. But it likely won’t be enough for Nio, which faces an overcrowded market at home and a foreign competitor that remains the 400-pound gorilla in the industry. And there is still the matter of its cars catching fire.\nEverbright Securities Co. Ltd. has forecast that Nio will stay in the red for the next three years, though its negative gross margin will narrow from -7.3% this year to -2.2% in 2021, the brokerage said in a note on Saturday.\nChasing Tesla\nFounded in 2014 and based in Shanghai, Nio boasts a slew of big-name backers that include Tencent Holdings Ltd., Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia Capital. It had a big-name chief development officer, Padmasree Warrior, a veteran of Cisco Systems Inc. and Motorola, before she left in December. Nio’s founder and CEO William Li is a serial entrepreneur and an angel investor.\nNio went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $6.26 per American depositary share, which was at the lower end of its price range. But its shares soared 76% on the second day of trading, making it a new star of the tech world with a market cap of $7 billion.\nNio aspires to be “China’s Tesla.” Its first model, the ES8, a seven-seat SUV, costs half as much as Tesla Inc.’s Model X in China.\nRead More\nTesla’s charge into China\nFrom June 2018 to this May, Nio sold 17,500 ES8s, and it received 12,000 orders for its new ES6, the company said.\nWhile Nio has said that it will feel less of a pinch than Tesla from the intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict, analysts have said otherwise — fierce competition in the industry and the capital-intensive nature of the business could weigh on the company’s growth.\nWith more than 400 players, there is severe overcapacity in China’s electric car industry, according to the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\nIn 2018, local governments announced new electric car projects involving 250 billion yuan ($36.2 billion) of total investment, official data showed. The planned new projects have a combined production capacity of 6 million vehicles. That’s a lot of capacity considering there were 1.25 million new-energy vehicles sold in China last year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The industry group has forecast sales of 1.5 million this year and 2 million in 2020.\nEverbright Securities expects Nio to sell 22,000 this year and 38,000 in 2021, according to its note.\nInvestors appear aware of the challenges facing Nio. Its stock price has come way down from its September high. It closed at $2.74 a share on Wednesday, giving it a market cap of $2.8 billion.\nBringing in help\nNio’s dreary profit outlook is why it has decided to bring in a new investor. In May, it announced plans to form a joint venture with Beijing E-Town International Investment and Development Co. Ltd., which will invest as much as 10 billion yuan in the tie-up. E-Town will offer support in building a new manufacturing facility for vehicles set to hit the market around 2021, Nio said.\nNio’s vehicles are currently produced in partnership with state-owned Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co. Ltd. In March, Nio abandoned a plan to build a factory in Shanghai two months after Tesla broke ground on its first facility in China.\nTesla’s $5 billion production complex in Shanghai will be both its first auto plant outside the U.S. and the first wholly foreign-owned electric vehicle project in China under new industry regulations.\nTesla has said that construction will wrap up this summer and the first China-made Model 3 will roll off the production line by the end of the year. According to Tesla’s fourth-quarter financial report, it aims for the Shanghai plant to produce 3,000 Model 3s each week.\nFires to put out\nStiff competition aside, Nio still has to convince consumers that its cars are safe. In April, a parked Nio ES8 burst into flames after undergoing maintenance at an authorized Nio service shop in the northwestern city of Xi’an. The company said later that an investigation determined that the fire was caused by a battery short circuit.\nThat same month, a parked Tesla reportedly burst into flames in Shanghai. The company said it was looking into the cause of the fire.\nThe incidents prompted the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to issue an order Monday demanding carmakers conduct safety checks and submit their findings by October. The ministry told automakers to check all of their vehicles, including those that have already been sold, for potential safety flaws related to battery boxes, waterproof protection, high-voltage wiring harnesses and on-board charging devices.\nThat same day, a second Nio ES8 caught fire in a parking lot in the central city of Wuhan, according to a report by the business news site KrASIA. Nio said it was investigating.\nContact reporter Jason Tan (jasontan@caixin.com)\nYouve accessed an article available only to subscribers\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-20'),

She previously covered environmental policy, politics, and climate change at Grist and the New Republic.\nTesla has fallen behind Vivint Solar and Sunrun in quarterly residential solar installations.\n8\nTesla sank to third place among U.S. residential solar providers for installations in the first quarter of 2019, continuing the one-time market leaders dramatic decline.\nThe latest ranking from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables shows Vivint Solar knocking Tesla out of second place. Sunrun’s direct solar business pulled ahead of Tesla in the second half of 2018.\nThats not to say that Vivint gained market share at Teslas expense. Vivint’s percentage of the market actually shrank, from a high of 11.6 percent in 2014 to 7.3 percent so far in 2019.\nThose figures underscore the magnitude of Tesla’s even more dramatic decline. Accounting for 32.6 percent of the market in 2014 as SolarCity, Tesla now lays claim to just 6.3 percent of the market this year.\nFIGURE: Leading U.S. Residential Solar Installers, 2013 - 2019 YTD\nSource: Wood Mackenzie U.S. PV Leaderboard\nOverall, WoodMac forecasts nearly flat 3 percent growth for the residential solar market in 2019. Tesla continues to be a depressing factor. The U.S. installed 603 megawatts of residential PV capacity during the first quarter, up 6 percent year on year.\n“The growth outlook for 2019 — like 2017 and 2018 — continues to be hampered by Tesla’s decisions to cut back on its customer acquisitions channels,” said Austin Perea, a senior solar analyst at WoodMac.\nSeveral shifts in sales strategy have left analysts skeptical about Tesla’s solar business, which it acquired when it purchased SolarCity for $2.6 billion in 2016. The company has wound down a partnership to sell solar in Home Depot stores and is moving to close many of its own stores, where it sold solar alongside batteries and vehicles.\nThat leaves web-based sales as Tesla’s strongest stream of purchases. In a recent report , Perea noted the company may not see a balancing of organic sales via web and referral sales until the second half of this year.\n“They have effectively cut out every single form of active customer acquisition,” said Perea. “We actually expect them to continue to see year-over-year declines relative to 2018 through 2019.”\nThe fall in residential installations comes amid wider turmoil in Tesla’s solar business. Reuters recently reported that solar cells produced by Panasonic at Tesla’s Buffalo, New York factory are actually being sent to the Philippines, rather than being used in Tesla’s trademark solar roof. In April, Greentech Media published a report digging into concerns about Tesla’s commitments at that plant and its capacity to scale the solar roof.\nTesla declined to comment on the latest residential installation numbers, and instead pointed to past statements.\n“For residential solar and energy storage, traditional industry-wide sales techniques require customized systems, installations and purchasing processes. This results in a cumbersome buying experience and limits market potential,” the company said in its Q1 letter to shareholders. “As we have done for the vehicle business, the key to accelerating mass adoption is to standardize the product offering, simplify the customer buying experience, and focus on the markets with the strongest economics. This results in cost efficiencies.”\nIts true that at the same time Tesla’s market share has faltered, its customer acquisition costs have dropped. In the second half of 2018, the company was spending $0.40 per watt to acquire customers. By the end of 2019, WoodMac analysts said Tesla could be spending “close to a quarter” per watt.\nAccording to the energy research firm, customer acquisition costs remain the most expensive portion of residential solar systems, accounting for 21 percent of total costs in 2018. Vivint and Sunrun have customer acquisition costs at $0.94 a watt and $0.90 a watt, respectively.\n“With current saturation levels, customer acquisition costs are not going to come down,” said Perea. “Tesla understands where the cost stack is right now and they’re able to rely on other business units … They’re diversified in a way that other models aren’t.”\nThe current leaders in residential solar, Vivint and Sunrun, have to rely on ballooning installation numbers to continue growing. Due to its luxury auto brand and its storage business, Tesla doesn’t.\nThe impending stepdown of the Investment Tax Credit, which drops to zero for customer-owned systems in 2022, means that many residential systems will go up in price, because cost declines will not match the loss of the incentive.\n“I’m not saying that Tesla is doing the right thing here, but I think they understand that existing customer acquisition costs aren’t going anywhere,” said Perea. “It’s becoming a fairly well-respected product at a cheaper price point than some of its primary competitors. That’s because they’ve been reducing their customer acquisitions costs actively.”\nAccording to analysts, the company is unlikely to beat competitors using the metric of installation volume that the solar industry has generally used to measure success.\nIf Tesla can bounce back from its current challenges and maintain its below-average costs to sign up new customers, it will have outwitted industry expectations and demonstrated that acquisition costs don’t have to be exorbitant — as long as you have a shiny brand name.\nRead more about WoodMacs ranking here .\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-19'),

Click here for Morning Brew’s privacy policy.\nStarsky Robotics is now testing autonomous trucks that have no driver inside, the San Francisco Bay Area startup announced on Wednesday.\nAs of June 16, Starsky began operating truly driverless semi-trucks on the Florida turnpike.\nIts a first in the industry. To be sure, there are plenty of autonomous trucks on the road. TuSimple has a fleet of more than 50 trucks making three to five revenue-generating routes per day in Arizona. Waymo resumed testing its self-driving trucks in Phoenix, after ending the tests two years ago. Embark s trucks drove more than 124,000 automated miles last year. And Tesla has been spotted testing some autonomous semis.\nBut these companies still have at least two people in the cabin for safety purposes — usually two truck drivers or a trucker and an engineer. Starksys trucks have neither.\nRead more: A company youve probably never heard of is quietly building a fleet of self-driving semis that could revolutionize the trucking industry. And the founder says it has one big advantage over Tesla, Uber, and Waymo\nStefan Seltz-Axmacher, CEO and cofounder of Starksy Robotics, said his company achieved the industry feat by way of one key difference between Starsky and the rest of the autonomous-trucking cohort.\nThat is, the trucks do have a driver. Its just that he or she is remotely controlling the vehicle, and several others, as many as 500 miles away.\nThe workplace of a remote Starsky trucker\nStarsky Robotics/YouTube\n\"Starsky isnt so much an autonomous R&D lab as much as we are keen in trying to solve a very distinct problem, and that problem is the persistent long-haul truck driver shortage in US trucking,\" Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, CEO and cofounder of Starksy Robotics, told Business Insider.\n\"Our focus is not so much building general autonomy in this really exciting pipe dream of artificial intelligence that can drive anywhere,\" Seltz-Axmacher said. \"What we really, really care about is making it so that trucks can drive without a person in them.\"\nRead more: Amazon Web Services is underpinning the technology at a $1 billion driverless trucking startup — and it shows how Amazon wants to control its supply chain and cut its $28 billion yearly shipping bill\nThe American Trucking Associations has said that the US has a shortage of 50,000 truck drivers and that the industry will need to recruit and train 898,000 new truckers by 2026. Trucking companies ranked the driver shortage as their top industry issue in 2017 and 2018.\nMeanwhile, salaries for truck drivers are falling. A Business Insider analysis found that median wages had decreased by 21% on average since 1980, while in some areas they have fallen by as much as 50%.\nSeltz-Axmacher said, because of that, there are fewer folks coming into the industry to drive goods across the country.\nStarsky co-founders Kartik Tiwari and Stefan Seltz-Axmacher\nCourtesy of Starsky\n\"The problem in the trucking industry is truckings commoditized, so you have a cap on the productivity of a driver, which means you cant pay them more than $60,000 a year,\" Seltz-Axmacher said. \"$60,000 a year isnt enough money to get someone to spend a month at a time in a truck.\"\nBut shifting trucking from a job on the road to an eight-hour office job could keep the trucking industry staffed, Seltz-Axmacher said.\nSome trucking executives see the autonomous feature as a way to cut labor costs . According to a Morgan Stanley report , implementing fully driverless trucks could save the industry $70 billion per year. Productivity would be up 30% because driverless trucks would run 24/7.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

At the rightmost lane, a Honda Accord violently slammed into the right wall, and because of the impact, the Japanese sedan bounced off and veered towards the left lane, straight into the Model 3.\nEverything happened in a split second. The Model 3 owner promptly took control of his vehicle, disengaging Autopilot and veering to the left before flooring the electric sedan’s accelerator. The Tesla Model 3’s electric motor’s instant torque immediately kicked in, allowing the vehicle to accelerate with such urgency that it cleanly evaded the out-of-control sedan.\nThank you for the torque on-demand to get me away from a runaway car @elonmusk @Tesla #100%torque very well have saved my life. https://t.co/SKvPgrDQRC\n— joel trimble (@Tropicrocket) June 20, 2019\nAs could be seen in footage taken from the Model 3’s built-in dashcam , the electric car was able to accelerate just fast enough to escape the Honda as it smashed into the median. Had Trimble been driving a vehicle with an internal combustion engine (which does not feature instant torque), his car might have been clipped, or worse, T-boned.\nIn a message to Teslarati, the INTELSAT chief architect noted that his Model 3’s torque was most probably the factor that ultimately saved him from what could very well have been a severe collision. “I love this car and the torque. I think the main message for me was the immediate torque. I honestly feel like it saved my life,” he noted.\nIt should be noted that all of Tesla’s vehicles are capable of accelerating at max torque in an instant. It should also be noted that Trimble’s Model 3 is a Long Range RWD variant, one of Tesla’s more conservatively-specced vehicles. With this in mind, the Model 3’s impressive feat in the dashcam video could very well be replicated by other cars in Tesla’s lineup, such as the Model S and Model X .\nThe Tesla Model 3 is among the safest vehicles on the road today, earning a perfect 5-Star rating from the NHTSA in all categories and subcategories. This is partly due to the vehicle’s well-equipped safety features, as well as its all-electric construction, which gives the Model 3 generous crumple zones both front and back. As shown in this recent video, it appears that even the Model 3’s impressive acceleration could be used to save lives as well.\nWatch a Tesla Model 3’s close call with an out-of-control Honda Accord in the video below.\nTesla owner taps into his Model 3’s instant torque to evade out-of-control car\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-20'),

The offer enables owners of the Powerwall home battery to sell their energy back to the grid at peak demand times, which means utility firms don’t need to fire up fossil fuels to meet demand.\n“I like the idea of being part of the clean energy future,” Mike Gingerich, a Powerwall owner in Amesbury, Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Our house will be part of the smart grid. It should help us pay for our system, reduce electric costs, and reduce pollution. What’s not to like?”\nIt’s a new level of integration for the renewable energy system, touted by CEO Elon Musk as a way of storing home-generated solar and wind for use around the clock. One Tesla Solar Roof owner in California told Inverse that the roof recharges the battery, then sells surplus energy to the grid for a small return.\nThis new program, known as “ConnectedSolutions,” means firms can tap into registered Powerwalls to plug the gap in energy production. That means firms don’t have to resort to starting up “peaker” plants to keep the lights on in an area.\nVirtual Power Plant: The Invisible Energy Supply\nA “virtual power plant” is nothing new, but it could be a growing means of providing clean energy.\nVermont has a similar scheme with Green Mountain Power. In July 2018, the firm reported that it called on 500 Powerwalls during a heatwave to plug the energy gap. These batteries worked alongside two solar storage facilities and other customer-provided sources to offset 17,600 pounds of carbon. This was the equivalent of taking 5,000 homes off grid, saving customers $500,000 in the process.\nIn May 2018, Tesla received approval to build the world’s largest virtual power plant. The project in South Australia sees 50,000 homes fitted with a 5-kilowatt solar panel system, plus a 5-kilowatt or 15-kilowatt-hour Powerwall 2 battery. The whole system is designed to produce 250 megawatts of power. The homeowners in the scheme don’t receive free electricity, instead sharing it around the community so everyone pays around 30 percent less on energy bills.\nVirtual Power Plant: How the New Project Could Change the State\nThe team behind the two new projects is confident that it could help reduce the load on the grid.\n“Reducing our carbon footprint to combat climate change requires new and creative solutions for our customers and communities,” John Isberg, vice President of customer solutions at National Grid, said in a statement. “We are pleased to have Tesla participate in our ConnectedSolutions program. By discharging customer-owned Tesla Powerwall batteries at appropriate times, we will reduce electric loads when it matters most to curb pollution, decrease infrastructure costs, and make the grid more sustainable.”\nFor Gingerich, the system enables him to protect his home against power cuts. In the winter months, that could help avoid freezing pipes.\n“Our Powerwall came online in February 2019,” Gingerich said. “Now if the grid goes out during a winter storm our house can go into Island mode and still charge the battery from the solar panels and provide power to the house to run our heating system and we don’t have to worry about our pipes freezing.”\nSolar installations in the United States are expected to double in the next four years, reaching four million by 2023. Prices have also dropped to outstrip coal in most areas of the country. California has also mandated that all newly-built homes include solar , a trend that’s expected to spread to other states.\nAs these new installs come online, they could find themselves part of a growing, invisible power plant.\nmore like this\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-21'),

But Edison brusquely dismissed Tesla’s idea for an AC system of power generation—largely because Edison had already invested heavily in promoting his own DC system.\nAdvertisement\nHundreds of central power stations were cropping up across America, each using different combinations of circuits and equipment. Edison’s Pearl Street generating station in Manhattan supplied DC power to a few hundred mansions of wealthy New Yorkers, as well as a smattering of mills, factories, and theaters in the city. George Westinghouse espoused AC, with more than 30 plants in operation by 1887. Whoever emerged victorious stood to gain a veritable monopoly on a highly lucrative market. When Tesla quit his job with Edison in a huff after being denied a promised bonus, Westinghouse was waiting in the wings and hired him.\nThats when things got nasty. Edisons propaganda machine pumped out hundreds of flyers and pamphlets on the dangers of alternating current, even electrocuting small animals in front of newspaper reporters. He called this being “Westinghoused.” Tesla countered with spectacular public lectures to demonstrate the safety of AC current, shooting sparks from his fingertips, making light bulbs glow, and even melting metals by running current through his body.\n\"My boys and I caught in a jar what before now has only flashed across the night sky.\"\nThe trailer gives us tantalizing flashes of much of this, opening with Cumberbatchs Edison announcing, \"My boys and I caught in a jar what before now has only flashed across the night sky.\" Tesla, meanwhile, tells Michael Shannons Westinghouse that he dreams of surpassing Edison and becoming \"the greatest provider of electrical power in the whole world.\"\nWe see the propaganda sheets, the claims that AC power will kill people, and lots of nifty-looking electrical equipment from that era—a time of rapid invention that essentially remade the world. “If you want to be remembered, it’s simple: Shoot a president,\" the films Westinghouse declares. \"But if you prefer to have what I call a legacy, you leave the world a better place than you found it.”\nOf course, we already know which man ultimately won the war of the currents. In 1893, the Columbian Exposition in Chicago chose AC to light up its “White City,” the centerpiece of its World of Tomorrow exhibit. That successful demonstration was sufficient to give the victory to Westinghouse and Tesla. But it will be interesting to see how well The Current War depicts these two larger-than-life personalities, and their shared antagonism, on the silver screen—a business sector where Edison did emerge victorious.\nThe Current War hits theaters October 4, 2019.\nListing image by YouTube/101 Studios\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-27'),

Teslas Autopilot Over Promises, New Report Finds - Forbes', 'Woman communicates by video call while her car is driven by an autopilot. Self driving and... [+] autonomous vehicle concept\nGetty\nDriving these days is a lot more complicated than ever, as vehicles become increasingly sophisticated with technology that helps drivers do things like stay in lanes and maintain speeds and following distances with minimal input.\nBut automation has limitations that can be difficult to grasp, according to two new studies that highlight how some drivers are confused about emerging systems.\nThe research was released on Thursday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a nonprofit financed by the insurance industry.\n“Current levels of automation could potentially improve safety,” David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute, said in a statement. “However, unless drivers have a certain amount of knowledge and comprehension, these new features also have the potential to create new risks.”\nThe institute looked at Level 2 automated systems available on vehicles that can be purchased today that can perform one or more parts of the driving task under supervision of the driver. The driver must continue to monitor driving and be actively engaged, the report said.\nOne study looked at system names, among the first ways drivers learn about a feature. The goal was to understand how a system’s name can influence perceptions of capabilities on the road; the study found how the names manufacturers use for these systems can send the wrong messages to drivers regarding how attentive they should be.\nMore than 2,000 drivers were surveyed about five Level 2 system names currently on the market: Autopilot (used by Tesla), Traffic Jam Assist (Audi and Acura), Super Cruise (Cadillac), Driving Assistant Plus (BMW) and ProPilot Assist (Nissan).\nEach participant was asked whether certain behaviors were safe while using that technology; respondents indicated if they would be comfortable doing a variety of tasks while using various systems.\nOne name in particular seemed “to over promise” when it comes to the degree to which drivers can shift their attention away from the road, the institute said. Tesla’s Autopilot “signals to drivers that they can turn their thoughts and their eyes elsewhere,” the survey found.\nMore respondents indicated that they felt it would be safe to take their hands off the steering wheel, talk or text on a cell phone, watch a video, read a book, look at the scenery or even take a nap while using Autopilot compared to other systems.\nThere have been several recent crashes involving Tesla’s Autopilot in which the drivers’ hands were not on the wheel, according to the report, which detailed how at least a few Tesla owners have been misusing Autopilot, “with fatal results.” Several recent crashes were cited, including one in March in which a Tesla driver crashed into the side of a tractor-trailer in Florida.\nA preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, the institutes study noted, “found that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash, and the driver’s hands were not detected on the steering wheel.”\n“Tesla’s user manual says clearly that the Autopilot’s steering function is a ‘hands-on feature,’ but that message clearly hasn’t reached everybody,” Harkey added. “Manufacturers should consider what message the names of their systems send to people.”\nThe second study found that drivers don’t always understand important information communicated by system displays, also called instrument clusters. These displays are critical because automated systems can become inactive or behave unexpectedly, which may require the driver to intervene.\nClick here for more information about the studies and to view a chart that shows percent of drivers who considered various behaviors safe while different Level 2 automated systems were in operation.\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Last week, local television stations in Los Angeles aired footage from viewer Shawn Miladinovich of a Tesla vehicle driving on LAs 405 freeway. The driver \"was just fully sleeping, eyes were shut, hands nowhere near the steering wheel,\" said Miladinovich, who was a passenger in a nearby car, in an interview with NBC Channel 4.\nMiladinovich said he saw the vehicle twice, about 30 minutes apart, as both cars traveled along the 405 freeway. The driver appeared to be asleep both times. He wrote down the vehicles license plate number and called the information in to 911, but the California Highway Patrol had not reacted by the time the vehicles went their separate ways.\nFurther Reading\nAutopilot was active when a Tesla crashed into a truck, killing driver\nAnother video of an apparently sleeping Tesla driver was posted to Reddit over the weekend—this one from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Reddit user who posted the video, MiloWee, said that she tried \"several times\" to wake him up by honking. \"It worked, but he fell back asleep,\" she wrote .\nWe werent able to independently validate either of the videos, so its possible theyre pranks. Back in March, a Twitter user posted a video of a Tesla driver apparently asleep at the wheel. Then someone else responded , saying that he was the driver in the video and that he wasnt asleep—he was just \"very relaxed.\"\nBut real incidents like this have happened in the past. Last month, police in the Netherlands pulled over a Tesla driver who appeared to be asleep and intoxicated. Another video posted in January appeared to show Tesla drivers asleep at the wheel.\nIn an incident last November, it took police in Silicon Valley seven miles to pull over a Tesla car with an apparently sleeping driver. He was arrested for driving under the influence. Another driver in early 2018 was discovered passed out behind the wheel of his stopped Tesla vehicle on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the man \"attempted to reassure arresting CHP officers onsite that the car was on autopilot.\"\nAdvertisement\nAutopilot may be saving the lives of drunk and drowsy drivers\nWe should be crystal clear about one point here: the problem of drivers falling asleep isnt limited to Tesla vehicles. To the contrary, government statistics show that drowsy driving leads to hundreds— perhaps even thousands —of deaths every year. Indeed, this kind of thing is so common that it isnt considered national news—which is why most of us seldom hear about these incidents.\nIncidents involving Tesla get more attention partly because people are very interested in Tesla stories but also because the design of Autopilot makes it relatively easy for the car to continue down the road without driver supervision.\nFurther Reading\nTesla’s autonomy event: Impressive progress with an unrealistic timeline\nSome cars dont have lane-keeping features at all, so a driver falling asleep means that the car quickly drifts of the road. Others have limited \"lane-keeping assist\" products that will warn drivers that theyre drifting out of their lane (and possibly jerk the steering wheel) but wont keep the car in its lane for long periods of time. Again, these cars will veer off the road relatively quickly.\nOn the other hand, the most advanced driver-assistance systems include sophisticated driver-monitoring systems. Cadillacs Super Cruise , for example, uses driver-facing cameras to verify that the driver is awake and paying attention to the road. If it detects that a driver isnt paying attention, it will alert the driver and eventually bring the car to a stop. Subaru recently introduced a similar technology called Driver Focus.\nTesla cars try to determine if the driver is holding the wheel by measuring the torque on the steering wheel. This is better than nothing; if a Tesla driver lets go of the steering wheel, the system will flash warnings and eventually bring the car to a stop.\nHowever, there are ways to defeat this—like attaching a weighted object to the steering wheel. And its possible for someone to keep their hands on the wheel while they drift off to sleep. Teslas vehicles also give drivers a relatively long time to put their hands back on the wheel— around 30 seconds in recent versions of the software, though it depends on speed and traffic conditions.\nSo we shouldnt assign too much blame to Tesla for sleeping-driver problems. Drivers fall asleep in every car model, and Autopilot has probably prevented some crashes that would have occurred without it.\nAt the same time, there is clearly room for improvement here. Tesla—and other carmakers building driver-assistance systems—could follow the lead of GM and Subaru and add eye-tracking technology to make sure drivers are actually paying attention to the road.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-18');

After incorporating learnings from the handful of Tesla solar roofs already in operation, Tesla Solar Roof Version 3 is said to look more like a standard roof to the untrained eye.\n“I’m really excited about version three of solar roof,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk told the audience at the annual shareholders meeting on June 11, hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.\nThe solar roof is perhaps one of Tesla’s most mysterious products, and its version numbers are relatively elusive. Musk first demonstrated the roof at an October 2016 event , which featured the house of the future alongside a Tesla Model 3 electric car and Powerwall battery powered by the solar roof. Musk said in August 2017 that both he and chief technology officer JB Straubel had installed the roof on their home.\nIt’s unclear how, if at all, later installations differed from these first constructions. Amanda Tobler, one of the first real consumers to install a solar roof, tells Inverse that Tesla did not specify the version number of the roof she had installed in March 2018.\n“They didn’t present it to me as ‘you’re getting a particular version’,” Tobler says.\nThe Tesla Solar Roof.\nTesla\nInstallations have remained relatively rare, a May 2018 report found that just 12 roofs had been installed in total.\nMusk explained the low installations by noting that the Tesla Model 3 ramp up had left the company starved for battery cells. These cells are critical, they are how the Tesla Powerwall is able to store excess energy harvested throughout the day and use it to provide power 24 hours a day. Tesla states it is currently fitting the product in eight states. With Musk declaring 2019 as the year of the solar roof , the third-generation tiles will have to make an even bigger splash than their predecessor.\nTesla Solar Roof V3: Features\nTesla has offered little detail about version 3. The January investor letter stated that the company would “ramp up” production “with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities,” based on the “design iterations and testing underway.” Installations would continue gradually “to gather further learnings from our design changes,” while learning more about the process by “implementing them in areas around the U.S. that are experiencing inclement weather.”\nThe tiles are also going to be built to last. The tempered glass that covers the tiles is reportedly three times as strong than slate or asphalt, and the company boasts an “infinity” warranty for the non-solar aspects. Musk’s most recent comments suggest that Tesla plans further improvements.\nTeslas solar roof tile animation.\nTesla\nA document leaked to Electrek suggests a big priority for Tesla is making the roof blend in with the rest of the house better, an important step if the Tesla Solar Roof is going to enter the mainstream. This means Tesla will have to create “custom-designed flashings and ridgecaps” around the home to maximize weather-proofing, and that the home’s vents and skylights are also modified to match the roof.\nMusk appeared to confirm these features in a Twitter post:\nMusk confirming the Electrek story.\nElon Musk/Twitter\nTesla Solar Roof V3: Price\nWhile the solar roof is already relatively cheap all things considered — roof installations are pricey — it will have to get even cheaper to incentivize people to make the switch. Right now, Tesla’s solar-generating tiles cost $42 per square foot, while non-solar dummy tiles cost $11 per square foot. As Tesla recommends at least 35 percent solar tiles on the roof, this means that a solar roof costs an average of $21.85 per square foot including both the solar and non-solar tiles. Energy savings, the company claims, will eventually make solar roof customers break even.\nTeslas roof costs.\nTesla\nEnergy savings might not be necessary to spur installations forever. During the recent annual investor event, Musk himself suggested that the total cost of the roof could reach even lower, low enough to beat the cost of a roof plus utility costs.\n“I don’t want to be over-confident on this, but I think we have a shot at being equal to a comp shingle roof plus someone’s utility costs, or maybe lower than that,” Musk told the audience.\nTesla Solar Roof V3: Release Date\nThe third-generation roof is currently undergoing tests to ensure it can meet the company’s lofty lifetime goals. These trials are expected to take place over six months to help the company simulate 30 years of wear.\nMusk claimed at the investor event that the company has nearly completed work on the new tiles. However, the promised Tuscan and slate-colored styles remain nowhere to be seen. If new color variants are part of the Tesla Solar Roof’s next iteration, we’ll likely be able to catch a glimpse of them soon.\nTesla’s solar roof is one of Tesla’s most audacious projects, the clean energy supplier for the home of the future. But Tesla still has many hurdles to clear, not only proving that their solar shingles can blend in on many kinds of roofs, but also that they can withstand inclement weather and the tests of time. To become a feasible option for everyday homeowners, it will also likely have to bring its costs down. The race is on.\nmore like this\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-18'),

Heres that boilerplate answer.\n\"We currently have well over half a million vehicles on the road, which is more than double the number that we had at the beginning of last year, and Tesla’s team of experts uses that data to thoroughly investigate incidents that occur and understand the root cause,\" a Tesla spokesperson told The Drive. \"Based on our research, we know that there are many external factors that can cause a fire to occur, including building fires, vehicle damage, improper maintenance by unauthorized mechanics, aftermarket modifications and improper vehicle charging.”\nTesla\nOne theory on the culprit resides in the lithium-ion battery cells that power each and every Tesla. Each Tesla battery pack is made up of thousands of these cells, and as an engineer on this Reddit thread surrounding one of the Model S fires pointed out, it has a known failure point.\n\"Lithium batteries can develop internal shorts spontaneously. Its a known failure mode. Depending on whether you overcharge, undercharge or overheat (which changes the threshold for what over or undercharging to a smaller envelope of operation), the battery can form lithium dendrites or copper dendrites which create dead shorts between the cathode and anode internally,\" he writes. \"Its inherent to the battery chemistry of all lithium battery types. This is why you have to both design the charge/discharge circuitry very carefully and you also have to have extreme reliability and variance planned into the design, manufacturing and operation. Its one of those lovely, high energy failure mode features you get from a system that has a hand grenades energy density multiplied by >100x.\"\nTesla\nThis could be the case with Tesla. Lithium-ion fires, however, aren’t limited to Teslas. Smaller household lithium-ion batteries, laptop lithium-ion battery packs , cellphone lithium-ion batteries , and even e-cigarettes have all had explosive episodes. In addition to the dendrite problems, manufacturing issues can be to blame as well. The Atlantic recently spoke with an attorney whos taken on a handful of lithium-battery lawsuit cases and believes that the country is being flooded by \"...a ton of batteries manufactured in China that are terribly made, completely unsafe... [and] rushed to be placed on the market.\"\n“Rushed to market” is a common phrase that hangs like an albatross on Tesla as it struggles to make a profit. We saw it in the use of non-automotive-grade materials that resulted in infotainment screens melting in the summer heat; a more germane case might be Teslas inability to foresee objects penetrating its battery packs in a crash. In 2014, after two high-profile accidents in which Tesla battery packs were ruptured and caught fire, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the issue. Though no recall was issued, Tesla added a titanium underbody shield to further protect the battery.\n\"Fire incidents involving Tesla vehicles are already extremely rare and our cars are significantly less likely to experience a fire than a gas car, however, we believe the right number of incidents to aspire to is zero,\" the spokesman told us. They added that Tesla has not “received any information to indicate that this fire [in Belgium] was a result of any issues with the battery.\"\nHowever, given Tesla’s reticence to disclose what caused fires in the past—as well as issue recalls—it’s unclear if the public is in any danger or if there’s a manufacturing issue that could be solved. In a similar situation, BMW was forced to recall thousands of cars and SUVs after an ABC investigation found more than 40 incidents of spontaneous and stationary fires. Theres a big difference between eight and 40—but that gap is shrinking as the year goes on.\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\nThe chronicle of car culture, delivered to your inbox.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-24'),

A sleek-looking Mustang with a Tesla-inspired interior is going to debut in Goodwood next month.\nUK-based startup Charge is behind the vehicle, which is not a conversation.\nThey are using officially licensed shells of both Fastback and Convertible 1960’s Mustangs and building the electric vehicle around the bodies.\nWe reported on them last year when they released the first images and announced the specs .\nThe powertrain includes a 64 kWh battery pack, a 300 kW electric motor, and DC fast-charging system supporting a 50 kW charge rate.\nCharge says that it can be configured for rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive and it can deliver up to 7,500 Nm of wheel torque and 1,200 Nm of motor torque.\n0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration can be achieved in just 3.09 seconds.\nWhile 64 kWh is a significant energy capacity for the size of the vehicle, the range is only expected to be 200 km (125 miles) – probably due to the aerodynamic performance of that old muscle car design.\nSpeaking of the old muscle car, they really did justice to the design of this American classic:\nBut they also embraced the fact that this is a modern all-electric vehicle and not a conversion, which means that it comes with a lot of technology.\nThe interior appears to have been inspired by Tesla’s Model S interior with the large vertical screen:\nWhen announcing the electric Charge Mustang last year, the startup said that it planned to make only 499 units and they would cost £200,000 ($254,000 USD).\nNow they are listing a price of £300,000 ($381,000 USD) on their website.\nThe prototype will be displayed for the first time at the Michelin Supercar Paddock at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK during the first week of July.\nHere’s a video of the vehicle at work in which you can see that it can switch from AWD to RWD and activate a “burnout mode”:\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

They went from 120 kW to 150 KW max capacity.\nWhile some owners were able to reach higher charge rates following this update, the overall charging curve didn’t seem to be optimized for the new capacity.\nIt appears to have been optimized with the release of the new 2019.20.2 software update when using the new On-route Battery Warmup feature.\nA Model 3 owner going by Wugz on Reddit tested the charging capacity after the update compared to the previous versions:\nHe explains the results from his tests:\n“Starting from 5%, the Model 3 long range pack now immediately starts charging at 125 kW (formerly 60 kW), and reaches 143 kW by 9% (formerly 13%). The peak rate is maintained until 45%, then shows a linear decrease to 118 kW at 50%, followed by a plateau until 59%, and after that the rate decreases linearly again. This “double hump” may be the new curve or may just be an anomaly with my (one and only) session.”\nIt results in a roughly 20% faster charge time from 5% to 80% state-of-charge, which is a pretty good example of a charging session.\nThe software update didn’t mention an improvement on the Supercharging cycle on V2 Supercharger stations.\nWe contacted Tesla about the impact of the 2019.20.2 software update on Supercharging, but we haven’t received a response yet.\nElectrek’s Take\nThat’s just one data point, but it’s an exciting result, especially when you consider that Tesla can significantly improve an important part of the ownership experience, charging, through a software update.\nSustaining power was never the biggest strength of Tesla’s Superchargers, but it now looks like they are improving on it.\nHopefully, Tesla can confirm the role of the software update and we will share details if we get an answer.\nIf you have some experience Supercharging on the new update, let us know.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

(Bloomberg)\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .]\nAn autonomous systems defense company contends it has successfully spoofed the GPS mechanism of a Tesla Model 3 using the automaker’s latest Autopilot technology, sending the vehicle off its intended route.\nRegulus Cyber said it used commercially available hardware and software to wirelessly divert the electric car using Navigate on Autopilot, a Tesla feature that — with driver supervision — guides a car along the highway, from on-ramp to off-ramp, executing lane changes and navigating interchanges along the way.\nAccording to Haifa, Israel-based Regulus, the car was 3 miles from a planned exit, traveling at a steady speed and in the middle of the lane with the Navigate feature activated when its test began. The car reacted as if the exit was 500 feet away, according to Regulus, slowing “abruptly,” flicking on the turn signal and turning off the road.\nWatch: @RegulusCyber CEO, demonstrating a real life #GPSspoofing of #mobile and explains the implications for #Automotive . Thank you Viodi for the great interview. https://t.co/eyeowYoUE9 pic.twitter.com/NX8dTmK0ox — Regulus Cyber (@RegulusCyber) May 14, 2019\nNow, to get this to work, the company said it had to install a 10-centimeter-long antenna on the roof of the target car. And Tesla, responding to questions about the software maker’s test, dismissed it as a sales ploy.\n“These marketing claims are simply a for-profit company’s attempt to use Tesla’s name to mislead the public into thinking there is a problem that would require the purchase of this company’s product,” a Tesla spokesperson said. “That is simply not the case. Safety is our top priority, and we do not have any safety concerns related to these claims.”\nBut the issue of GPS spoofing has hovered over autonomous driving from its inception. Relying on a wonky signal to get to your destination in a normal car simply may mean missing your exit. Relying on it to keep your car on the right path at 60 mph is something else entirely. Now that the public has awakened to autonomous driving getting closer to reality, addressing consumer safety concerns will be critical to facilitating mass adoption.\nIn a 2018 paper winkingly titled “All Your GPS Are Belong to Us: Towards Stealthy Manipulation of Road Navigation Systems,” researchers demonstrated the possibility that spoofing—substituting pirate signals for those of a GPS satellite — stealthily could send you to the wrong destination.\nWhile they note the threat of GPS spoofing has been discussed as far back as 2001, and that spoofing has been shown to work in other contexts, their experiment was the first to test road navigation systems. The researchers used real drivers behind the wheel of a car that was being told to go to the wrong place.\nSome 38 out of 40 participants followed the illicit signals, the researchers said.\n“The problem is critical, considering that navigation systems are actively used by billions of drivers on the road and play a key role in autonomous vehicles,” wrote the authors, who hail from Virginia Tech, the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Microsoft Research.\nAnd while cars with autonomous features have additional tech to protect against spoofing, they cautioned that other studies raised the specter of attacks on other systems, such as ultrasonic sensors, millimeter-wave radar, lidar (light detection and ranging) and wheel speed sensors.\n“These new semi-autonomous features offered on new cars place drivers at risk and provides us with a dangerous glimpse of our future as passengers in driverless cars,” said Roi Mit, chief marketing officer of Regulus Cyber.\nCurtis Kexiong Zeng, one of the authors of the 2018 study, said in an interview that successfully spoofing a Tesla Autopilot system depends on what kinds of maneuvers the car can make based on GPS location and without driver participation or permission.\n“Generally speaking,” he said, “the threat of GPS spoofing increases as the level of automation goes up.”\nSo what about this test by Regulus Cyber?\n“This is entrepreneurial hacking,” said Colin Bird-Martinez, senior analyst in connected car software at IHS Markit. The Regulus attack is both time and labor intensive, he said, and relied on someone placing an antenna on the car itself, something any reasonably alert motorist likely would notice.\nAnd the impact was extremely limited, he said — the Model 3 didn’t crash; it just braked and took a different road.\n“You can hack anything if you put the effort into it,” Bird-Martinez said. But in this case, he said he’s not all that worried.\nAnother reason spoofing is unlikely to succeed is Tesla’s onboard computer. It uses GPS, radar, maps and cameras to funnel data into a central processing unit, where a final driving decision is made in a process known as sensor fusion. Tesla vehicles don’t use GPS or maps to control the steering of the car, and also learn when to disregard faulty information.\nYou’ve likely seen the process yourself, if you’ve ever used GPS in a city. Your little blue dot will wander off a street and into the middle of an office building. The computer, knowing you’re likely not driving through a building, realizes the signal is incorrectly placed and uses other data (from cell towers or other known waypoints) to place you back on the road.\nIn fact, researchers concluded that any patch for a spoofing risk likely will involve those other sensors.\nThe Regulus attack is, however, a good reminder that “nothing is really foolproof at the moment,” said Kevin Mak, principal analyst of the automotive practice at Strategy Analytic. Systems Autopilot are not fully autonomous — they are, as the company is quick to point out, driving assistance.\nCurrent systems “aren’t capable of driving the vehicle by themselves,” Mak said. “You need the driver to be aware and capable of taking over.”\nMore Content About:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-19'),

They are now giving props to Tesla and saying that electric vehicles are coming to the US in masses in a new op-ed in a major newspaper.\nKlaus Zellmer, CEO of Porsche North America, penned an opinion article called ‘Porsche thinks you’ll want your next car to be electric’ in USA Today, the largest publication by circulation in the US.\nIn the piece, the executive lays the case for “electric cars to soon be common on American roads.”\nThe CEO wrote:\n“Tesla has made inroads, but now I believe we are approaching a turning point. In coming years we will see more widespread adoption as volume producers including General Motors, Nissan, and VW join with premium brands like Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche to launch numerous battery-only models. As more Americans experience the instant power and sporty handling that electric cars provide, more will want this new generation of electric vehicles.”\nZellmer noted that the increasing deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure is rapidly making EVs more convenient to own in many markets.\nWith improving technology and infrastructure, the CEO sees more compelling all-electric options hitting the market and consumer demand rising.\nHe even acknowledged that Tesla was the one to prove that consumer demand is strong with Model 3.\nFirst, Tesla has proven there is significant demand for cars that combine sustainability with performance and design. Last year, the Model 3 outsold any other premium sedan in the U.S. We know that American consumers embrace new technology, especially if it delivers a new experience. And once a technology catches on, consumers respond well to expanded choice as competitors enter the field. Just look at how many models of SUV you can buy today, or the proliferation of smartphones since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007.\nOf course, Porsche wants its own compelling all-electric option on the market and Zellmer noted that it’s coming with the Taycan. Other models will follow.\nZellmer says that based on the interest shown in the Taycan , they already expect to sell all their units available for the US through late 2020 to people who signed up with dealers.\nYou can read the full op-ed here .\nElectrek’s Take\nOf course it’s nothing new for most Electrek readers who have been on board with electrification for a while now, but it’s nice to see an exec from a legacy automaker that has most of their business still coming from gasoline cars acknowledge the trend.\nIt’s also great to see them give credit where credit is due and name Tesla, which is not something automakers do often. They usually try to act as if other automakers don’t exist and they operate in a vacuum.\nWhen an automaker that just not so long ago was really reticent to go all-electric is now saying those things in the opinion section of a major general publication, it should help convince some naysayers to at least open themselves to the possibility of considering an electric car as their next vehicle.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Scientists believe this is the first step in creating a whole new type of magnet technology that could lead to a better understanding of a variety of applications, including nuclear fusion and interplanetary rockets.\nThe new magnet relies on a high- temperature superconducting material. This material is then chilled to the levels of the liquid nitrogen that traditional superconductors rely on. As the superconductor is cooled below the temperature at which it loses electrical resistivity — know as its critical temperature — its ability to handle higher currents grows. This allows it to achieve higher magnetic fields, and ultimately reach 45.5 Tesla.\nTypically, superconductors cannot withstand magnetic fields beyond 30 Telsa. The electrons that allow it to maintain its quantum superconducting properties become too unstable at that level, causing the superconductor to lose the properties that make it zero-resistant. Not so for the new model, thanks to the liquid helium that actually enhances its superconductivity.\nAnother factor that aids in the ability of the magnet to withstand the added Tesla is its insulation — or lack thereof. In traditional electromagnets , there is a layer of electrical insulation inserted between the superconducting tape. Not so with the new magnet; instead, scientists took non-insulated tape and applied multiple layers to their creation. These layers operate similarly to a single-layered thick superconductor, allowing the electron pairs to avoid any impurities in the insulation, which in turn allows the magnet to handle even stronger fields.\nWhile this is a record-breaking achievement, the scientists behind the magnet aren’t content to rest on their laurels. Instead, they have their eyes on an even loftier goal — reaching 50 Teslas of field strength . In fact, some of the researchers on the team are convinced that their new breed of superconductors could one day even achieve 60 Teslas. But for now, much more research and experimentation on the superconductors and their insulation will be required. Until that time, the scientists will continue to investigate the intricacies of the new magnet and superconductor, and work to understand how these principles could provide us with far greater magnetic fields than ever before.\nRelated Terms:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-19'),

Tonopah is midway between Reno and Las Vegas on U.S. 95, Nevadas Electric Highway. Read more Chris Erskine / Los Angeles Times / TNS\nby Chris Erskine\nUpdated\non Jun 21, 2019, 12:01 a.m. ET\nWe were taking a smarty-pants car through honky-tonky country — Reno to Las Vegas. Our route: U.S. 95, Nevada’s Electric Highway, a mostly two-lane road that has been peppered with charging stations to meet the growing demand of electric vehicles, or EVs.\nAlthough still a fraction of the market, EV sales are surging. Nevada, which has seen 40 percent growth, embraced charging stations after determining the need for them outside urban centers.\nThis is a 440-mile road trip into the future. Yet it’s also an escape into the past, through ghost towns and past ancient stores and buckaroo saloons, even crumbling bordellos.\nWyatt Earp once worked these ornery outposts, and the feisty ethos of the American West still roams the gritty lunar landscape.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a case of the New West meeting the Old West along a remote route that reminds us of the travel pleasures that make us sing inside: open road, silver vistas, and plenty of room to zip around that lumbering RV.\n\"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair ...\"\nWe were in a pearl-white Tesla Model 3, with a 325-mile range, dual motors, and an autopilot feature that redefines what it means to drive — cerebrally, physically, spiritually.\nWe picked up the new Model 3 in Reno. It’s a smaller version of the Model S you’re accustomed to seeing — and far more affordable, starting at about $35,000 (with add-ons, our test drive priced out at $46,950).\nMy 3-amp brain nearly exploded as I tried to absorb all the features, including a leap-of-faith driver-assist system in which you turn over steering and lane changes to the car’s software. Technically, this is not a self-driving car, but you can smell one from here.\nThree hours later, we locked ourselves out of it.\nOK, so there’s a learning curve. It’s a genius machine, no doubt, smarter than all the smart people you know mashed together.\nBut suddenly, I was standing next to this brilliant little buggy, locked out of it 130 miles into our trip, a pit stop we took earlier than needed to sample the charging experience.\nWith a Tesla Model 3, you don’t have a key; you have a phone app that controls the motors, the charging, the door locks. And in the middle of nowhere, 10 miles from where God left his shoes, my phone was locked inside this car.\nI had a fallback, the little card the car rep gave me. I dug it out and swiped. I was back inside the car, where the giant iPad-like screen said we still had 45 minutes left to charge in the town of Hawthorne, near Walker Lake.\nThe extended pit stop is an issue with electric vehicles. In a traditional car, you could gas up, grab a burger, and be gone in 20 minutes; with the EV, a thorough recharging takes an hour or more.\nThat would seem a significant drawback.\nIn time, and 200 more miles of desert road, it would seem like something else. First impressions are usually so wrong with me.\nBecause, initially, I loathed this confusing little car.\nThe scenery, on the other hand, was pure tranquillity.\nOn our two-day journey, we would pass only half a dozen towns of much texture or consequence.\nNevada has company in its quest to place and subsidize charging stations on rural routes like this. By 2020, it aims to expand the Electric Highway to the entire state, joining other states on the forefront of the EV revolution. California, where sales of electric vehicles increased 84 percent in 2018, aims to develop charging facilities like these to handle an estimated 1.5 million vehicles by 2025. Arizona and Nevada have joined six other states in a program called REV West, which is amplifying the region’s EV charging grid.\nThe route along U.S. 95 is Nevada’s overture. Overlapping that is Tesla’s proprietary system of charging stations.\nThe added pit stops relieve what is called \"range anxiety\" amid EV drivers. A welcome byproduct is how it changes the pace of the trip itself.\n\"It’s a return to road-tripping the way it used to be,\" said David Bobzien, director of the Governor’s Office of Energy, which administers the Nevada program.\nThat seemed an audacious claim as this superstar sedan steered us around another bend, then braked for a slow-moving semi. No question this autopilot took some getting used to.\nBut Bobzien’s point was spot on: The hour charging period slows travelers enough that they can knock about roadside attractions, chat up the locals, peek into old jails and elegant courthouses.\nMidway between Reno and Vegas, we came upon quirky Tonopah Station, a rambling casino-motel decorated with stuffed grizzlies and a 10-foot-tall knockoff of the \"Mona Lisa\" painting.\nThe must-see stop came 27 miles farther south: the gutty little town of Goldfield , which sports an ornate haunted hotel, a blast-from-the-past high school (also haunted), and an ancient bordello made of fieldstone and naughty lies.\nThe founders of Goldfield, a bustling gold camp and Nevada’s richest city from 1905 to 1910, built state-of-the-art public buildings, some still open for view. Visitors can also collect gems on the edge of town, then weigh them at a gift shop. (It’s the honor system.)\nWith reservations, you can search for ghosts in the Goldfield Hotel or the old high school , both under renovation and worthy of attention. We toured the school, built in 1907, and marveled at its architectural touches, such as a stained-glass skylight and grand staircase.\nI have way too many passwords, most based on dead pets and failed high school relationships. My life is already overrun with charging cords and fussy little gadgets. So when it comes to driving, I just want to turn the key and go.\nYet as the miles passed, I grew to enjoy this sophisticated computer/car, which can be as high- or low-tech as the driver chooses. Tap this or wiggle that, and it becomes a conventional car. Click down twice on the right wand, and it pretty much drives itself.\nI find in it a sense that the future isn’t something we jump into; we ease the wheel a little at a time — this way, then that — until it begins to feel comfortable.\nI also found in this Wild West adventure a reminder of the joys of road trips: the feel of the wheel and the buzz you get from goosing the accelerator to slip around that weaving hay wagon.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-21'),

But specifically, in the case of the Tesla 3, we decided to go public on this simply because it was a car that was already available to consumers. It’s already widespread around the world.\nAs manufacturers inch towards truly autonomous driving systems, the danger of GNSS spoofing represents a clear and present danger to drivers, he warned.\nThe researchers were able to spoof GNSS signals using a local transmitter mounted on the car, to stop it affecting other cars nearby. However, broader attacks extending over several miles are possible, and Russia has systematically spoofed GNSS signals to further its own interests, according to a recent report on the dangers of GNSS attacks.\nTodd E. Humphreys, co-author of that report and associate professor at the University of Texas department of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics, described the attack as “fairly distressing” to Naked Security yesterday. He added:\nThe Regulus attack could be done from 10Km away as long as they had a line of sight to the vehicle.\nDoes this mean nightmare scenarios in which a terrorist could drive all the Teslas in a 10km radius off the road into concrete bollards, killing their owners? It’s unlikely. For one thing, NoA combines vehicle sensors with the GNSS data, and would only turn off the highway if it spotted road markings that indicated an exit. The Regulus attack was only able to force an exit from the highway onto an alternative ‘pit stop’ with exit markings.\nA more realistic attack would involve misdirecting the Tesla’s navigation system to take the left-and-right turns it expected, but at unintended junctions, Humphreys told us.\nThe Tesla vehicle would have enough visual and radar smarts that it wouldn’t drive off the road into a tree.

Altogether, hes probably racked up a whopping 3,000 NoAP miles. So in May, when Consumer Reports released its critical story, I asked Alan to check it out. Did he agree?\n\"I dont,\" he said. \"The car never cuts off anybody, as they say it does. If anything, its been too cautious for my taste, though it sometimes brakes aggressively before a lane change, even if theres a car closely following. Ive been getting honks and headlight flashes.\"\nHeres the skinny: In its current (optional-settings) version, which doesnt require a turn signal authorization, Navigate on Autopilot will attempt to follow a nav route from freeway on-ramp to exit, including lane changes to pass slowpokes or skooching over to a connector link. Unlike our often wrong-aimed eyeballs, NoAP is a hydra of never-blinking robot eyes looking every which way: an ever-vigilant forward-looking radar, eight video cameras staring in all directions, and 12 ultrasonic sensors that furiously echo pulses within a 26-foot perimeter.\nBut CRs drivers werent impressed by its subsequent decision-making: \"In practice,\" Consumer Reports Keith Barry wrote, \"we found that the new Navigate on Autopilot lane-changing feature lagged far behind a human drivers skills. The feature cut off cars without leaving enough space, and even passed other cars in ways that violate state laws, according to several law enforcement representatives CR interviewed for this report. As a result, the driver often had to prevent the system from making poor decisions.\"\nThey characterized its moves as sometimes nerve-wracking. \"Its incredibly nearsighted,\" Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports senior director of auto testing, said in the story. \"It doesnt appear to react to brake lights or turn signals, it cant anticipate what other drivers will do, and as a result, you constantly have to be one step ahead of it.\"\nBut Alan has had a different experience and disagrees with Consumer Reports complaint: \"Not reacting to brake lights and turn signals might be the right thing to do. Humans often dont use a signal, or they leave it on and forget about it, which would be extremely confusing and contribute to what Tesla owners know as phantom braking. My experience is that it quickly predicts somebody about to change into my lane without indicating, even slowing down when theyre still physically in the other lane.\"\nAs for me? Brake lights appear fractionally before a car begins to physically slow, so thats a critical early alert. And if, as Tesla told CR, NoAP is recognizing brake lights (and turn signals), then Id like to read a long, detailed study about its effectiveness. A turn signal is more of an appreciated politeness. But frankly, the best tip-off to lane-change intentions is the other drivers eye and head motions, reflected in their side mirrors.\nSee all 15 photos15 photos\nUnlike single-lane driving with adaptive cruise control and lane centering ( Cadillac s Super Cruise being Autopilots only serious rival at these), the game of lane-change checkers doesnt play out so obviously in front of you. Its happening in your small side mirrors, or worse, in your blind spots.\nBut theres methodology and belief, and then theres the actual experience. On his transcontinental jaunt from Chicago to L.A., Alan averaged 730 miles per day at 70 mph, each day, stopping three to four times to supercharge. Although the traffic was generally light, dodging potholes (which NoAP cant predict) had him on continuous alert.\nDriving on lightly trafficked interstates through Americas heartland might result in NoAP working flawlessly, but the Road Warrioresque L.A. freeways are another matter. We wanted to get a firsthand sense of whos right—Alan or Consumer Reports. Heck, depending on how the software and settings were programmed, both could be right.\nSo we borrowed a Model 3 from an MT employee and headed out onto the 405 freeway in some early-afternoon Friday mayhem. Our car was using 2.5 hardware and 2019.12.1.2 firmware; the more recent 2019.20.1 adds automatic zooming of the screens visualization of your blind spots, conditional speed limits depending on time and weather, and a push notification at 20 percent of battery state of charge when using Dog mode. (Editors note: While pitched as being in \"beta\" form and frequently being updated via over-the-air upgrades, Navigate on Autopilot is nonetheless available to the general public of Tesla owners, which makes evaluating it as a fully-formed product necessary. )\nAt first the car was reluctant to change lanes at all. Alan set the Speed Based Lane Changes aggressiveness at average (theres three profiles, from Mild to Mad Max). \"The other lanes just arent moving much better for it to bother to try,\" he said. So we stepped it up to Mad Max.\nThen things started happening. The screen displays a pending lane change, Alan has his hands on the wheel (the system requires this before proceeding), the turn signal begins blinking automatically without Alans prompting, and the car starts making hesitant weaves toward the intended lanes markers. Im watching the drama through the side mirror.\nAfter a few aborted attempts, the Tesla finally goes for it, and we slot into the next lane, mission completed. A few minutes later it does the maneuver again. Then again. Same behavior each time. None seemed like we were cutting anybody off, but the series of wobbly sniffs at the next lane has an indecision about it. If its not sure, why should I be?\n\"Using the system is like monitoring a kid behind the wheel for the very first time,\" CRs Fisher said. \"As any parent knows, its far more convenient and less stressful to simply drive yourself.\" Actually, in our case, this waffling over the lane change—yes, no, yes, no, yes—seems more like a stiff-necked, elderly driver.\nPersonally, my confidence would be reassured if the cars screen display of lane markings and icons of nearby cars depicted a larger-scale scene. Teslas already the best at communicating whats in the cars immediately vicinity—directly ahead, to the side, directly behind. But a lane change involves players moving around in a lot more real estate than that.\nAnother crack in my confidence began to spread as we crept along at the merger with California State Route 90. To the right, a large truck loomed, slightly ahead and edging ever closer to us. And closer. And closer. Finally, Alan tapped the brake and turned away before we collided. Why isnt a truck the size of an elephant noticed by the side camera and proximity sensors?\nTo those who frequent Reddit and Tesla owner forums, this isnt the first time such an incident has been mentioned. And to be sure, weve tested non-Tesla cars with ACC and LC—having to take evasive action to avoid collisions with close-merging cars that those cars forward-facing camera didnt see. But in this case, we were a bit surprised that the Teslas additional cameras and proximity sensors missed the elephant in the next lane.\nTesla notes that the optional, non-default setting has already successfully driven tens of millions of miles since its release, and that NoAP executes more than 100,000 safe lane changes every day on the worlds highways.\nIn fact, the cars on-screen prompt—when changing from user-activated lane changes to automated lane changes—has a pretty stern warning: \"You may choose to disable the turn signal confirmation for automatically-initiated lane changes, but you must be aware that lane changes may happen quickly and at any time. Disabling the turn signal confirmation does NOT alleviate the driver of their responsibility to keep their hands on the wheel and carefully monitor the vehicles surroundings. \"\nI mention to Alan the CR claim that, in their hands, NoAP executed illegal lane changes. He confirms it has happened to him, as well. \"With HOV lane usage turned off, it still occasionally tries to pass in the carpool lane anyway when it fails to recognize it.\"\nSee all 15 photos15 photos\nAlthough our test drive was brief, Alan says that what we encountered was pretty typical of his experience in the last few months, including occasional incidents such as that truck crowding in on us. Tesla requested the VIN of our private owners Model 3 so they could evaluate the incident and provide comment, but our owner preferred not to share that information. Not knowing all the details, Tesla declined to comment on the incident.\nHowever, the NoAP systems frequent software updates make predicting its behavior a moving target—such as its now more aggressive braking before lane changes, earlier migration into the correct lane for an offramp, and more frequent occurrences of phantom braking.\nSo is Consumer Reports right, and is Alan being too forgiving of this rather erratic software programming?\nIt depends on your tolerance for a new type of driving. Right now, all these systems require you to be a vigilant monitor. Even Cadillacs ACC and LC Super Cruise, which Im a big fan of, needs my periodic intervention. Does that mean its dangerous? No. But they ask us to understand that what we classically think of as \"driving\" is transforming into a driver-and-semi-automated collaboration. Unfortunately, some Tesla buyers and shoppers mistakenly believe Autopilot means they can drive hands-free. That is an incorrect assumption.\nRead More Tesla Model 3 vs. BMW 330i: Who Is the Better Luxury Sedan? Porsche Taycan Gets Three Years of Free Public Charging Driving a Tesla Model S from SF to LA on a Single Charge\nSo perhaps the questions were asking should be reframed: Is Teslas Navigate on Autopilot worth collaborating with? Questions like this arent going away; as with a lot of automotive technology, Tesla is just among the first to force us into some unfamiliar new conversations. For instance, Nissan recently announced Pro Pilot 2 in Japan, which is very similar to NoAP except, like Super Cruise, it uses eye tracking to ensure a driver is monitoring the road, and it requires a lane-change confirmation button to be pressed (and like Tesla, it doesnt include lidar in its sensor suite).\nAs for Alan, well, he approves of using NoAP, which he says is regularly adjusting with over-the-air updates. But how about you? If youre a Tesla driver using NoAP, briefly tell me about your experience. How many miles and where do you use it? What firmware is it running? What lane-change and Cruise Follow settings do you use? Any incidents? Do you like it? Dont? Please be dead honest, as its a serious conversation we all need to share.

(Credit: Adwah/Reddit)\nPosted on\nJune 25, 2019\nA Tesla owner recently tapped into the Model 3’s built-in dashcam feature to help authorities following a high-speed, multi-car collision. With the driver who caused the accident reportedly attempting to pass off a false narrative to authorities, it was ultimately the Model 3’s dashcam footage that provided a clear, objective account of the incident.\nTesla Model 3 owner and r/TeslaMotors member u/Adwah was driving on US Route 50, a few miles before the Eastern Shore Bridge in Maryland, when a Dodge Durango sped past the electric sedan, seemingly trying to use the merge lane to pass on the right. Following this incredibly reckless maneuver, the Dodge driver unsuccessfully attempted to thread the needle, hitting two vehicles and another Model 3 in the process.\nThe collision was notable, and authorities eventually arrived on the scene. Before leaving the scene of the multi-car crash, the Model 3 owner informed the police that the electric sedan captured footage of the entire incident. The authorities eventually followed up with the Tesla owner, stating that the driver of the Durango was claiming that he was swerving to avoid a speeding vehicle behind him. Unfortunately, none of the other drivers involved in the collision could confirm or deny the Dodge driver’s account.\nFootage from the Model 3’s built-in dashcam was then submitted to the police. With video evidence proving that the Durango driver was driving recklessly, and with footage from the Model 3’s side cameras showing no car speeding behind the SUV, authorities were able to clarify the facts of the incident. According to the Tesla owner, the police proved quite curious about the Model 3’s built-in dashcam capabilities, which arguably helped provide an objective account of the multi-car collision.\nUnfortunately, the other Model 3 that was hit by the Dodge Durango was not able to capture any footage of the incident, since the vehicle’s owner had not yet set up the feature. Later updates from the r/TeslaMotors community member note that the other individuals involved in the collision did not incur any serious injuries, though some had to be taken to a medical facility due to their vehicle not deploying its airbags. A copy of the dashcam footage had also been sent to each of the drivers whose vehicles were hit by the recklessly-driving Dodge Durango.\nTesla’s built-in dashcam feature is arguably one of the most useful features that have been released by the electric car maker through a free, over-the-air update. Since its rollout, Tesla’s built-in dashcam capabilities have helped owners in numerous ways. One Model 3 owner, for example, was able to avoid a potential insurance scam after a cyclist intentionally crashed into his electric car. More recently, a Model 3 owner was able to prove to police that a truck driver was at fault after his car was damaged in an ill-conceived three-point turn .\nWatch the Tesla Model 3’s footage of a speeding Dodge Durango (and the resulting multi-car collision) in the video below.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-25'),

And thats especially clear with the Vision M Next concept, a striking plug-in hybrid thats as quick as an M8 yet can go around 60 miles on EV power alone. Youve seen the photos and learned about the concept , but keep reading to learn about what the new BMW is like in person plus what angle Adrian van Hooydonk, senior vice president of BMW Group Design, especially likes.\nActually Youre Right, BMW\nMore than just text in a press release, the Vision M Nexts dual-opening grille is faithful to the brand but really does have a sense of depth to it. Behind the silver grille trim youd expect and the laser-etched pattern you might not, Thrilling Orange paint brightens up the trim behind the silver-accented grille. The effect powerfully emphasizes the latest evolution of a key BMW design element.\nAbout Those Headlights…\nIn person, Im still not a fan of the headlights. I dont mind that the headlights arent placed on either side of the grille—as on almost every production BMW sold today except maybe one —but Im not a fan of how small the headlights appear compared with the enormous dual-opening grille. If you see the Vision M Next at an auto show, judge it for yourself.\nSee all 27 photos27 photos\nLOVE This\nCould you tell from the photos that the black on the lower side skirts is composed of recycled carbon fiber? Besides being a cool idea, the textured appearance this provides is subtle and effective.\nWheely Nice\nThe rear wheels 1 one inch larger than the 21-inch fronts, and although its possible that staggered look had some subconscious effect on my appreciation of the BMW concepts design, the more obvious orange accents on the rear wheels captivated me. Even though Im still not sold on the \"silk-matt\" Cast Silver paint over the Thrilling Orange accents, I like the idea of painting the rear wheels as a way to draw attention to the cars performance (BMW says the car can use rear-wheel drive or an EV-based all-wheel drive).\nVan Hooydonk says that \"[designers] job, as I see it, is to have more ideas than the company can build,\" a comment that could apply equally to specific details as well as the car as a whole.\nSee all 27 photos27 photos\nJust Enough Heritage\nThe Vision M Next nods to BMWs supercar past with the three-piece glass louvers. I found the lower rear diffusers to be far too blocky and aggressive, but then again, this is a concept car, and the rest of the rear design makes up for it.\nAlso, take another look at our gallery of BMW photos to see the other detail fans may appreciate: the 3-D-effect taillights that feature BMW roundels from the M1 and Turbo.\nGood Point, Adrian\nWhether the Vision M Next previews an i8 successor thats already in the works or is simply meant to attract future-looking enthusiasts to the brand, van Hooydonk suggests the concept may have already done its job.\n\"Here, our job was to make people dream,\" he says about the concept. Oh, one of his favorite angles of the car? Its the rear three-quarter view. From that angle, you can see the M1-inspired rear, plus the reinvented Hofmeister kink incorporated into the sculpted side panels.\nSo, What About Tesla?\nVan Hooydonk didnt explicitly reference the industry-shifting electric-car brand, but he did defend the Vision M Nexts plug-in powertrain as one logical path to the future of the sports car. One leading idea at the #NEXTGen event was the way autonomous and sports-car driving can live in the same electrified world. As the automotive industry figures out which powertrain technologies will emerge on top in the face of tightening regulations, BMW arguably has more flexibility than Tesla , which makes the best-selling luxury car in the U.S. (the Model 3). BMW can produce a one-off 5-Series-based EV with acceleration in the same league as the Tesla Model S P100D while also preparing a successor to its plug-in hybrid sports car. Even though most automakers remain years behind Tesla in popularizing electrification, this powertrain flexibility could be an advantage in the short term, before EVs continue to add range like the Model S just did .\nAs for the Vision M Next, its easy to appreciate its design in person. Although there are a couple things this humble author and not-designer might change, the design represents BMWs desire to make an electrified vehicle seem sexy, a goal I can definitely stand behind.\nSee all 27 photos27 photos\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-25'),

EPA investigators have performed off-site partial compliance evaluations for the Fremont facility twice since last December, suggesting that the Title V permit compliance issues that Tesla recently downplayed in a public statement have attracted interest beyond the local regulator which is currently negotiating penalties for 19 notices of violation .\nAccording to records in the detailed facility report maintained in the EPAs ECHO database , EPA investigators lead off-site partial compliance evaluations of Teslas factory on December 18, 2018 and again on April 4, 2019. When contacted for comment, the EPA declined to elaborate on the specifics of its activities at the Tesla factory, citing an agency policy of not commenting on \"potential or ongoing enforcement activity.\" An EPA spokesperson did provide the following brief statement on its compliance evaluation process:\nEPA works cooperatively with our federal, state and tribal regulatory partners to monitor and ensure compliance with clean air laws and regulations in order to protect human health and the environment. EPA routinely conducts on-site and off-site compliance evaluations to perform our Clean Air Act program oversight functions. These evaluations are prompted by a variety of reasons, including tips or complaints that suggest non-compliance, criteria-based targeted compliance evaluations, and random compliance evaluations.\nEPA spokesperson\nSeparately, a BAAQMD spokesperson tells The Drive that \"Air District staff accompanied EPA on their inspection of Tesla and also conducted separate inspections to determine compliance with Air District regulations,\" but that \"the Air District did not request the joint inspection.\" Though it is not yet clear why exactly the EPA decided to hold inspections absent a request by the local management district, the pair of compliance evaluations in such a short timeframe stands out as a unique occurrence in the historical records for this facility.\nTwo compliance evaluations in under six months also stands out in the broader context of reduced EPA enforcement actions in recent years, in particular evaluations and inspections which declined from about 15,000 in 2015 to about 10,000 in 2019 [PDF]. One of the agencys explanations for the recent decline in EPA enforcement actions is that it has pushed more enforcement responsibility onto local agencies as part of an effort to foster \"cooperative federalism\" in environmental compliance [PDF].  According to that strategic initiative,\n\"Examples of the types of situations that could warrant EPA involvement in individual inspections and enforcement following close communication and involvement of upper management of both agencies include, but are not limited to:\na) Program audits indicate a need for the EPA to fill a gap until the State program deficiency is addressed.\nb) Emergency situations or, situations where there is significant risk to public health and the environment.\nc) Significant noncompliance that the State has not timely or appropriately addressed.\nd) Actions that require specialized EPA equipment (e.g., infrared camera) and/or expertise.\ne) Federal and State Owned/operated facilities.\nf) Actions to consistently address widespread noncompliance problems in a sector/program (such as the National Enforcement Initiatives 2), to address companies with facilities in multiple States,or where there are cross-boundary impacts affecting other States, tribes, or nations.\ng) Program oversight inspections.\nh) Responses to State requests for assistance in a specific situation, or broader work-sharing arrangements in which the EPA takes the lead in particular sub-programs, sectors, or geographic areas.\ni) Serious violations that need to be investigated and addressed by the EPA s criminal enforcement program.\"\nEPA guidance memo\nThe Drives reporting suggests  that Teslas Clean Air Act compliance challenges are related to repeated modifications of its paint shop as well as the unpermitted construction of a new general assembly line in a temporary structure, following the failure of CEO Elon Musks ambitious, highly-automated general assembly lines. Last year, Tesla paid BAAQMD $139,500 in penalties [PDF] over a far more limited series of violations taking place between 2013 and 2016. On April 17 of this year Tesla has made its first-ever request for a permit variance before BAAQMDs hearing board, suggesting that the increased local and federal attention has already begun to change its attitude toward Clean Air Act Title V permit compliance.\nA BAAQMD spokesperson tells The Drive that it \"is working to ensure Tesla’s permit accurately reflects their operations and complies with all air quality regulations,\" and that it \"continues to inspect, monitor, and review all operations at the Fremont facility to ensure compliance with all regulations.\" Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment.\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\nThe chronicle of car culture, delivered to your inbox.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-24'),

Charley Gallay/Getty Images for E3/Entertainment Software Association\nJust two years ago, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk was among the 10 most admired CEOs in America. Company review site Glassdoor’s annual “Top CEOs” list ranked him No. 8 in 2017, among hundreds of large companies’ chief executives in the U.S.\nBut since then, Musk’s approval rating has been on a straight decline. In 2018, his rank on Glassdoor’s list dropped to No. 49. And this year, he was nowhere to be seen in the top 100, according to Glassdoor’s latest ranking released on Wednesday.\nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk Says He Made Less Than $0 in 2018\nGlassdoor ranks CEOs by a percentage approval rate derived from employee reviews. Historically, only reviews from SpaceX were considered for Musk’s annual CEO ranking, because the employee approval rate at his other company, Tesla (TSLA) , was consistently lower.\nThis year, the top 100 people on the “Top CEOs” list have an approval rate ranging between 90 percent and 99 percent. Musk’s current rate stands at 89 percent at SpaceX (based on 1,700 employee reviews) and only 68 percent at Tesla (based on 1,500 reviews).\nThis disparity is consistent with what we found in other staff review-backed CEO rankings. Last December, a “Best CEOs” list produced by Comparably placed Musk as 14th among America’s 50 best CEOs—based on SpaceX employee feedback. Had opinions from Tesla staff been considered, Musk would have fallen below the top 50.\nAccording to Glassdoor reviews, long hours, low pay and chaotic management are three primary complaints at Musk’s companies.\n“Work-life balance blows hard. Sometimes 14- to 16-hour days aren’t enough,” wrote an anonymous SpaceX employee in February 2019. “And when you leave, you can be made to feel guilty for ditching the team.”\n“C-level executives tend to make company decisions rashly and publicly via Twitter,” wrote a Tesla employee in June 2019, referring to Musk’s frequent tweetstorms about important Tesla news, which often lead to wild swings in Tesla’s stock price.\nIn the “advice to management” section, the person wrote, “Cancel Elon’s Twitter account.”\n“Elon, you keep having the good employees fired. Trash management and HR is killing your business,” wrote another Tesla employee who self-identified as having worked at the company for more than three years. “You are losing good employees to a boys club and have done nothing about it.”\nHere are the top 10 people on Glassdoor’s 2019 “Top CEOs” list:\nPat Gelsinger, VMware\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-20'),

And nowhere is that belief more innate than in Silicon Valley, where companies like Tesla , Uber, Lyft, and Snap command dizzying valuations based on the belief that one day, they will indeed make money. Raising fresh billions to fund operations, boosters of these companies would have us believe, is a regular rite of passage. After all, didn’t giants like Amazon , Apple , Facebook , and Google also burn through tons of cash on their path to profitability?\nFortune decided to find out: How much money did Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google spend in their early years? And how does that compare with what today’s hot names are spending? To get the numbers, we went back to each company’s earliest published financial reports, starting with the offering statements for its IPO.\nIt turns out the assumption that successful tech companies burned lots of cash in their youth isn’t merely wrong—it’s staggeringly wrong. Look closely at the early days of the giants—the Fab Four, as we’ll call Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (now Alphabet), and you’ll see that they were models of frugality compared with the new wave (which we’ll dub the Breakneck Burners: Tesla, Uber, Lyft, and Snap).\nIt’s true that in the dotcom frenzy of the early 2000s, many tech companies posted losses while devouring new funding. But the ones that burned piles of cash were such failures as Webvan and eToys.com, not winners like Google. Today, says accounting expert Jack Ciesielski, “you’ve got these companies chewing through mountains of cash, and investors are comparing them not with the failures of the dotcom era but with the survivors.”\nFor this analysis, the crucial measure isn’t net profit but “free cash flow” (FCF), calculated by taking “cash generated by operating activities” minus capital expenditures (capex). In other words, business income minus money you spent to grow your business.\nThe differences are stark. Let’s start with Google. Amazingly, the company appears never to have been significantly cash flow negative. Similarly, Apple never showed negative free cash flow starting with its first full year in business and weathered only short-lived deficits as a mature player. Facebook showed just two years of negative FCF (in 2007 and 2008, when it burned $143 million).\nAt Amazon, long the poster child for taking losses today to earn profits tomorrow, the numbers seem almost quaint. The new venture had negative FCF of $10.6 million from 1994 to 1997, but that was just a fraction of total sales. The only major underwater span in its history came from 1999 to 2001, when negative FCF totaled $813 million. But by 2002, Amazon’s FCF turned positive. All told, the Fab Four had total negative free cash flow in their early years of almost exactly $1 billion.\nBy contrast, the Burners have already torn through $23.9 billion, encompassing 22 years of FCF deficits and outspending the Fab Four by around 20 to 1. At this pace, will they ever reward investors? Here’s the outlook for each.\nTesla\nCash burn (total negative FCF): $10.9 billion over 12 years.\nOutlook: Negative FCF ballooned to $4.1 billion in 2017 but narrowed the following year to a (comparatively) modest $222 million. The reprieve was short-lived, as Tesla began to spend heavily to ramp up production of its mass-market Model 3. In the first quarter of this year, sales tumbled, and FCF fell to minus $945 million, forcing Tesla to raise $2.4 billion in equity and debt funding. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas shocked the markets by lowering his previous “bear case” for Tesla’s stock price from $97 to $10, citing dangers of slowing sales in China. Jonas warned that declining overall demand is pushing back the date when Tesla will be able to fund itself from operations.\nJonas’s price target (all targets are for 12 months from now): $230\nCurrent price: $216\nUber\nCash burn: $8.9 billion over three years (not including losses from earliest years).\nOutlook: In the offering statement to its long-awaited IPO in May, Uber revealed FCF numbers from 2016 through 2018. In 2016, Uber posted negative cash from operations of $2.9 billion and spent $1.6 billion in ­capex, for a negative FCF of $4.5 billion. Since then, the shortfalls have been shrinking, although they have remained substantial as the company has offered price promotions to customers and spent heavily on the launch of its Uber Eats food-delivery service, raising sales and marketing expenses by 25% in 2018 and 54% in Q1 of 2019. Tom White of brokerage D.A. Davidson tells Fortune, “Uber has bought itself some time with good recent performance on revenue and bookings. But by the end of this year, investors will start thinking of 2020 as hopefully the year where meaningful progress is made toward profitability.” If quarters keep slipping by without concrete progress, he adds, investors “will get discouraged or impatient.”\nWhite’s price target: $46\nCurrent price: $42.33\nLyft\nCash burn: $1.36 billion over three years and one quarter (not including losses from earliest years, which were not specified in the IPO prospectus).\nOutlook: In 2016, Lyft burned $496 million in FCF, and since then, the trajectory has improved only slightly. The shortfall shrank a bit to $350 million in 2018, but in Q1 of this year, it stood at $110 million. Lyft is asset-light, but it’s still spending so heavily on such basics as driver pay, insurance, R&D, and marketing that operating losses have continued to mount. Dan Galves of Wolfe Research points out that Lyft depends on dense urban markets for nearly 60% of its business, despite those areas making up only 5% of U.S. households. And annual growth in those metro areas, he reckons, has slowed to 24%, half the rate in early 2018. Galves also cites high driver costs that “are taking almost all the revenue” and doubts that Lyft will win broad appeal outside the big cities.\nGalves’s price target: $52\nCurrent price: $58.32\nSnap\nCash burn: $2.72 billion over four years (not including losses from earliest years, which were not in IPO filings).\nOutlook: Snap is still burdened by big research expenses, equal to one-third of its total costs, and R&D needed to expand its photo-sharing platform is expected to jump to over $900 million this year. Additionally, it’s instructive to look at how much cash Snap is burning in relation to all the money it collects marketing its service. From the start of 2017 through Q1 of this year, Snap had $2.33 billion in revenues and churned through 73% of that amount, $1.71 billion in cash. Michael Pachter of Wedbush notes that although user and revenue growth is impressive, “the road to profitability appears to have gotten longer.” He’s concerned that big spending on ­infrastructure and R&D has pushed back the date when Snap will show positive Ebitda to at least Q4 of 2020.\nPachter’s price target: $12.25\nCurrent price: $13.62\nA version of this article appears in the July 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline “The Biggest Burners.”\nMore must-read stories from Fortune:\n—When the next recession hits, 4 good things could happen\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-20'),

Buying Tesla insurance meant a commitment not to drive in a “crazy way.”\n“They can, but then the insurance rate’s higher,” Musk said.\nMusk’s new comments to shareholders June 11 came about a week before Porsche announced Oregon and Illinois vehicle owners can now sign up for insurance policies from the OEM.\nThe FAQ for the Porsche Auto Insurance on Thursday describes a system focused on repair quality and customer service, as well as privacy. Any Porsche from the 1981 model year forward is eligible.\nPorsche will charge a base rate and then an additional amount based on the miles you drive, according to the OEM. The driver merely needs to shoot a photo of his or her odometer and upload it monthly — no dongles or other monitoring is required.\nInsurance Technologies Corporation CEO Laird Rixford told Insurance Business America that other OEMs were likely to launch their own insurance, according to a Friday article.\n“This is where connected vehicles will be transforming the insurance industry,” Rixford said, according to Insurance Business America. “Moving forward, you’re actually going to see more of this because car manufacturers are looking for other ways to monetize their vehicles after the sale, and doing insurance plays is always something they’ve wanted to – it’s just without the connections, they’ve been unable.”\nRixford told Insurance Business America OEM insurance programs wouldn’t be edging out traditional brokers and agents until 15-20 years down the road, though these comments might have been more in reference to OEMs insuring autonomous vehicles rather than typical cars.\nCNBC reported May 4 that Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, whose company owns No. 2 GEICO, didn’t see OEMs as a threat.\n“It’s not an easy business,” Buffett said, according to CNBC.  “The success of the auto companies getting into the insurance business is probably as likely as the success of the insurance companies getting into the auto business.”\nHe told Berkshire Hathway shareholders that “I’d bet against any company in the auto business” getting into insurance.\nHowever, OEMs have both a parts and a customer loyalty stake in the insurance claims process, and potentially are far more at risk from poor-quality repairs than insurers. They’re also not wedded to 100 years of tradition in how to evaluate risk and charge premiums and can jump right to new telematics-based systems or models of insurance.\nConsider Porsche’s sales pitch:\n“When life happens, we get you back on the road and behind the wheel of your Porsche vehicle as quickly as possible,” Porsche wrote. “With Accident Assistance we tow your vehicle to the nearest qualified Porsche Approved Collision Center. Our network of Porsche Approved Collision Centers provides quality collision services and uses Porsche Genuine Parts. Our Claims Concierge is with you every step of the way during the claims process to answer any questions. While your Porsche is being repaired, we provide rental reimbursement on a high-end rental vehicle to drive until your repairs are complete.”\nAgreed value coverage and diminished value coverage are also standard, Porsche confirmed Monday.\nThe company opted for a lower-tech pay-per-mile insurance system relying on uploading photos of the odometer monthly rather than in-vehicle tracking. However, Porsche said software does analyze the images themselves to check for fraud.\nPorsche partnered with Mile Auto on the coverage — it’s not completely going it alone.\nA Porsche FAQ stated its insurance included comprehensive and collision. We asked if Porsche felt drivers would be willing to split off those lines of coverage rather than pursue all policies at a single carrier — or even bundle auto with even more coverage, such as home.\n“Porsche Auto Insurance offers full coverage auto insurance, including property damage and uninsured/underinsured coverages, to help protect you if your vehicle is involved in an accident or is stolen or damage,” Porsche wrote in a response Monday. “Porsche Auto Insurance also offers homeowner, multiple vehicle, and Porsche Club of America member discounts.”\nPorsche said auto glass coverage also was included in all policies.\nOEM certification and insurance might focus more on quality than traditional insurance direct repair programs, which emphasize cost-cutting. But automakers do care about cost of ownership on the front end — such as higher insurance premiums driven indirectly by higher claim costs. With in-house insurance programs, the repair costs would directly affect the automaker.\nHowever, when we asked Porsche if it was requiring further concessions on its certified shops following the launch of Porsche Auto Insurance, it said no.\n“There are no specific requirements, caps or limits when it comes to vehicle repair,” Porsche wrote in a response. “Porsche Auto Insurance is committed to properly repairing each Porsche vehicle.”\nMore information:\n“Tesla Annual Shareholders Meeting” (See insurance comments around 1:54:25)\nTesla YouTube channel, June 11, 2019\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-24'),

It’s the latest record-breaking statistic involving Norway and electric vehicle (EV) records as the Scandinavian nation looks to stop sales of fossil fueled cars by 2025.\nThe numbers could be even higher, but thousands of Norwegians find themselves on long waiting lists as dealerships struggle to import enough vehicles. According to industry figures , a total of 11,518 EVs were registered in Norway during the first quarter of 2019, twice as many as the previous year. The new Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf and Volkswagen Golf account for the majority of registrations.\nAlthough unit sales in China and the U.S. are far higher, it’s Norway that remains the poster child of the EV revolution. That’s because there are far more EVs on Norwegian roads as a proportion of total vehicles than anywhere else in the world. Constant headlines over the past few years have left many people scratching their heads as to why a little Scandinavian nation with a population just over 5 million leads the EV revolution. The answer is simple: favorable environmental math, and financial incentives.\nTesla showroom with a red Tesla Model S full-sized electric five-door hatchback on display.\nGetty\nA platter of incentives\nDespite its reputation as a major oil industry player, almost all of Norway’s domestic energy comes from hydropower. Because so much of the country’s electricity is renewable, a switch to EVs is a much greener equation than it would be for countries whose electricity comes from high-polluting coal-fired plants. To make the switch happen, the Norwegian government has invested heavily in financial incentives and charging infrastructure.\nAs far back as 1990, the government began to introduce incentives for EV owners. Big changes started to come at the turn of the millennium when road tax was lowered, charges for toll roads and public ferries were removed, and free parking offered in some municipal car parks.\nNorway’s 25% sales tax was removed from new EV purchases in 2001, and drivers were permitted to use bus lanes from 2005. Although the country’s extensive charging infrastructure was kick-started by government money, private companies are now taking over operations and there has been a lot of interest from overseas.\nThe government met its target of 50,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road three years earlier than planned. Despite this, the current center-right coalition has kept most of the incentives in place to at least 2021.\nTax cuts for the wealthy?\nWhile the political will might be environmental, many Norwegians have benefited financially. Trondheim-based computer engineer Berge Schwebs Bjørlo, 34, bought a Tesla Model S with his partner back in 2015, calling the decision a no-brainer. \"We compared the total cost of ownership of a petrol car with the Tesla. With the high cost of fuel and daily use of toll roads, owning a petrol car worked out considerably more expensive than the monthly payments and electricity cost of an electric car.\"\nSome in Norway have criticized the wide-ranging incentive package as nothing more than tax cuts for the wealthy. Some even suggest it’s simply a discount on a second car for the rich, and therefore doesn’t do anything to take petrol cars off the road.\nBecause Norway’s used car market remains dominated by petrol cars, those who cannot afford to splash out on a new electric car can’t take advantage of the lower cost of driving. Both Bjørlo and his partner work full-time and are child-free. Were their circumstances different, he accepts that they wouldn’t have been able to take advantage. \"As many of the subsidies are for ongoing costs like tolls and parking, it is to a certain extent giving a cost of living saving to the wealthy. But in the bigger picture, it’s society overall that benefits.\"\nHe points out that Norwegian cities such as Bergen have suffered so much from pollution that drastic measures have been introduced to limit the amount of cars: \"In the winter pollution is so bad that you are only allowed to drive your car on certain days of the week, dictated by your registration plate.\"\nA belief in batteries\nNorway’s electric obsession looks set to continue beyond cars. Avinor, the state-owned operator of the majority of the country’s airports, has announced its desire to use electric-powered aircraft on short-haul flights by 2030. Meanwhile, Scandinavian Airlines have teamed up with Airbus on hybrid research.\nThe country also leads the world in the transition to battery technology for shipping. An all-electric passenger vessel already operates on the picturesque Nærøyfjord, ahead of the fjords becoming zero-emission zones by 2026.\nPrime Minister Erna Solberg spoke on the importance of electrification and energy storage at the opening ceremony of Siemens new battery factory in Trondheim earlier this year:\n\"For most countries, the first phase of the green shift is the transition from coal to renewables. Thanks to our waterfalls, Norway has already entered the next phase: How can we use our clean energy to electrify other sectors? We need to replace the fossil fuels used in other sectors with clean electricity to mitigate global warming. We need better batteries for ships and trucks so they can travel longer distances.\"\nCan other countries replicate Norway?\nChristina Bu is the secretary general of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, which represents more than 50,000 EV owners. Despite the success of Norway’s methods, she doesn’t believe other countries can replicate it like-for-like because their circumstances will be different. \"But there are elements to consider, such as bus lane access or free public parking that don’t cost much. Instead of raising taxes, countries like Sweden are about to shift car taxes onto higher polluting vehicles, so the overall tax take remains the same while encouraging more people into EVs,\" she said in a 2017 interview .\nThe problem in Sweden\nAs recently as 2010, Sweden had more new electric car registrations than Norway. Today, Norway’s numbers are ten times that of their Scandinavian neighbors. The Swedish government has attempted to kick-start sales through generous grants and has achieved some success. New sales numbered 6,694 in the first five months of the year, more than three times the figures of the previous yet. But there’s a problem. Demand for electricity in cities is increasing faster than the supply can keep up, especially in the capital Stockholm.\nTo solve the problem, industry group Power Circle suggests incentivizing EV owners to charge only at certain times of day, and even send power back to the grid during peak times. The theory then goes that instead of increasing sales of electric cars being the problem, it becomes the solution. “Electric cars can make or break the grid. When we are about to roll out the infrastructure why not be smart about it and use it to support the power networks?” Power Circle’s Johanna Lakso, told Bloomberg .\nFollow me on Twitter .

That is simply not the case. Safety is our top priority and we do not have any safety concerns related to these claims.\"\nTesla official spokesperson\nSo, a company most of us havent heard of tells us that its demonstrated disturbing vulnerabilities in Tesla. Tesla, in effect, says said company is just looking for a buck and theres no problem, but it doesnt really provide any details. Where does the truth lie? That question necessitates a look at the merits of this specific Regulus-vs-Tesla claim—and then a broader glance into the history, technology, and possibilities of GNSS spoofing itself.\nA closer look at the Regulus demo\nIf you read the opening paragraph of this article and thought that evil hackers took remote control of a car and made it go violently off-road, no strings attached, dont feel bad—you were almost certainly meant to. But the reality is much different. The first, most obvious objection is that Regulus physically affixed an antenna to the roof of the Model 3 and wired it into its systems before the demonstration. That isnt really the smoking gun it appears to be; it wouldve been possible to get the same effect with no antenna or wires, it just would have been extremely irresponsible (and most likely illegal).\nEnlarge / This small antenna was affixed to the Model 3s roof before running the GNSS spoofing demo.\nRegulus Cyber\nWell get into some of the hairy technical details later, but GNSS spoofing is typically a broadcast attack which can be expected to affect a large area. Putting an antenna on the roof of the Model 3 allowed Regulus to use far less power than would otherwise be required, and therefore the firm could be far less worried about accidentally impacting other, unrelated GPS devices nearby. That said, I dont mind giving them a pass on this one; presumably real bad guys would have fewer constraints and thereby wouldnt need to bother with the physical antenna and wiring in order to attack someones car. The real problem is a little less obvious, and youre unlikely to spot it unless you find Regulus Cybers actual blog post on the experiment—which is much more detailed, and conspicuously not linked directly from the press release.\nAdvertisement\nA very similar, earlier experiment performed by Regulus Cyber in January of 2019. The car being attacked is convinced to take the wrong road—but its still on an actual road. This is a critical detail.\nThis video from an earlier experiment is an excellent example of the kind of \"Pied Piper\" attack that Regulus successfully carried off against the Model 3. Its entirely possible—even somewhat trivial, if you dont mind becoming an instant felon—to use GNSS spoofing to convince an autonomous or semi-autonomous car that it isnt where it thought it was, and it should turn on the wrong road.\nBut this attack is like handing Mom or Dad the wrong map on a family vacation: sure, you might get lost, but the wrong map wont plow the car into a tree. Just like the human driver in our example, an autonomous or semi-autonomous automotive application only uses the GPS to decide which road to take; what is or is not a road at all is decided by local sensors. In a human drivers case, \"local sensors\" mostly means a pair of good old-fashioned Mk I Eyeballs; in the Teslas, its radar, ultrasonics, and a suite of eight cameras enabling full-time 360-degree visual coverage.

Another found that drivers don’t always understand important information communicated by system displays.\n“Current levels of automation could potentially improve safety,” IIHS President David Harkey says. “However, unless drivers have a certain amount of knowledge and comprehension, these new features also have the potential to create new risks.”\nThe automation available in vehicles available for purchase today is considered Level 1 or 2, which applies to systems that can perform one or more parts of the driving task under supervision of the driver. An example of a Level 1 system is lane centering, in which lateral control of the vehicle is automated, or adaptive cruise control, in which longitudinal control — i.e. speed and following distance — is automated. Systems that can perform both of those functions simultaneously are Level 2 systems.\nThese systems are a far cry from Level 5 automation, in which the entire driving task can be performed without input from a human under all conditions.\nLevels of driving automation\n(developed by SAE International) Level 0 The human driver does everything. Level 1 An automated system can assist the human driver in conducting one part of the driving task. Available on vehicles that can be purchased today. Level 2 An automated system can assist the driver with multiple parts of the driving task. The driver must continue to monitor the driving environment and be actively engaged. Available on vehicles that can be purchased today. Level 3 An automated system conducts all of the driving task without driver engagement and monitors the driving environment, but the human driver must stand by to intervene in response to a system failure or request from the system to take over. Level 4 An automated system can conduct the entire driving task without driver input but only in certain conditions (e.g., limited to 25 mph) or places (e.g., a city center). Level 5 An automated system can perform the entire driving task without driver input under all conditions System names\nDespite the limitations of today’s systems, some of their names seem to overpromise when it comes to the degree to which the driver can shift their attention away from the road. One name in particular — Autopilot — signals to drivers that they can turn their thoughts and their eyes elsewhere, an IIHS survey found.\nFor the survey, more than 2,000 drivers were asked about five Level 2 system names currently on the market. The names were Autopilot (used by Tesla), Traffic Jam Assist (Audi and Acura), Super Cruise (Cadillac), Driving Assistant Plus (BMW) and ProPilot Assist (Nissan). Participants were told the names of the systems but not the vehicle brands associated with them and weren’t given any other information about the systems.\nNone of these systems reliably manage lane-keeping and speed control in all situations (see “IIHS examines driver assistance features in road, track tests,” Aug. 7, 2018). All of them require drivers to remain attentive, and all but Super Cruise warn the driver if hands aren’t detected on the wheel. Super Cruise instead uses a camera to monitor the driver’s gaze and will issue a warning if the driver isn’t looking forward.\nEach participant answered questions about two of the systems chosen at random. They were asked whether particular behaviors were safe while using that technology.\nWhen asked whether it would be safe to take one’s hands off the wheel while using the technology, 48 percent of people asked about Autopilot said they thought it would be, compared with 33 percent or fewer for the other systems. Autopilot also had substantially greater proportions of people who thought it would be safe to look at scenery, read a book, talk on a cellphone or text. Six percent thought it would be OK to take a nap while using Autopilot, compared with 3 percent for the other systems.\nAt least a few Tesla owners have been misusing Autopilot in this way, with fatal results.\nIn March, a Tesla driver crashed into the side of a tractor-trailer in Florida. The Model 3 went completely under the truck, shearing off the Model 3’s roof and killing its driver. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash, and the driver’s hands were not detected on the steering wheel.\nThe same was true in the crash of a Tesla Model X in California one year before (see “Fatal Tesla crash highlights risk of partial automation,” Aug. 7, 2018) and a 2016 Florida crash of a Model S that also involved the side of a tractor-trailer.\n“Tesla’s user manual says clearly that the Autopilot’s steering function is a ‘hands-on feature,’ but that message clearly hasn’t reached everybody,” Harkey says. “Manufacturers should consider what message the names of their systems send to people.” Instrument cluster information\nIf a system name is one of the first ways a driver learns about a feature, another source of information is the instrument cluster. Displays are important because they tell a driver how a system is responding to situations or when a system is temporarily inactive. For example, a lead vehicle may disappear from the display when that vehicle is cresting a hill and no longer detected by the system’s radar. Similarly, lane lines may disappear from the display when the lane markings on the road are no longer visible to the system’s cameras.\nThe second recent IIHS study looked at whether drivers understand this information from the display of a 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class with the Drive Pilot system. The E-Class display is typical of displays from other automakers.\nEighty volunteers viewed videos recorded from the driver’s perspective behind the wheel of the E-Class. The participants were asked about the operating status of the adaptive cruise control and lane-centering features. If the features were inactive, the participants were asked to explain why. Half of the participants first received some training in the form of a brief orientation about the instrument cluster icons pertaining to the two systems.\nUnderstanding these displays is important because automated systems can behave unexpectedly  and changing circumstances may require the driver to intervene.\nIn the study, certain key pieces of information eluded many of the participants. While almost everyone was able to understand when adaptive cruise control had adjusted the vehicle speed or detected another vehicle ahead, most participants, regardless of whether they received the training, struggled to understand what was happening when the system didn’t detect a vehicle ahead because it was initially beyond the range of detection.\nMost of the people who didn’t receive training also struggled to identify when lane centering was inactive. In the training group, many people got that right. However, even in that group, participants often couldn’t explain why the system was temporarily inactive.\n“If your Level 2 system fails to detect a vehicle ahead because of a hill or curve, you need to be ready to brake. Likewise, when lane centering does not work because of a lack of lane lines, you need to steer,” says Harkey. “If people aren’t understanding when those lapses occur, manufacturers should find a better way of alerting them.”\nSome systems use audible alerts in those situations in addition to visual signals. That may help, but drivers often find audible alerts annoying. Another option is making the pertinent visual signal more obvious and understandable.\nAlthough systems ideally should be intuitive, providing an orientation at the dealership could also help. The study showed that interface-specific training helped drivers notice changes in lane-centering activity and use the correct icons to determine system status.\nDownload full report .\nMIT Most Used Where Intended\nThe automated systems available in vehicles today are designed to be used only on certain types of roads. A recent study by researchers from IIHS and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s AgeLab found that, for the most part, drivers use the technology where it was intended, though they may not be using it enough to have a measurable effect on safety, and some individuals may be using the systems on roads they weren’t designed for.\nFor the study, a project of the Advanced Vehicle Technology Consortium, volunteer drivers spent four weeks driving either a Range Rover Evoque with adaptive cruise control or a Volvo S90 with adaptive cruise control and Pilot Assist, a Level 2 system that enhances the adaptive cruise control with lane centering. During the study, the S90 underwent a software update that improved the lane centering, so the researchers looked separately at those who drove the S90 before the update and those who drove it after.\nLike most driving automation in currently available vehicles, these systems are meant to be used on interstates and other freeways.\nIn the study, 40 percent of interstate and other freeway miles of Evoque drivers were driven using adaptive cruise control. Before the software update, 11 percent of interstate/freeway miles in the S90 were driven with adaptive cruise control alone and another 11 percent were driven with the Level 2 Pilot Assist system. After the update, those numbers were 8 percent and 20 percent, respectively.\n“Driving automation could reduce crashes by eliminating some of the potential for human error,” says IIHS Senior Research Scientist Ian Reagan. “But given the low use of the systems and the fact that most vehicles on the road today still don’t have these features, we don’t expect to see these crash reductions any time soon.”\nFar smaller percentages of miles traveled on nonfreeway roads in the study involved automation.\nVehicle manuals often give ambiguous instructions about where to use these types of systems, sometimes saying only that they are for “highway use.” It’s not always clear if nonfreeway arterials should be considered “highways” or not.\nOn the one hand, these roads often have higher speed limits and free-flowing traffic, and so in that sense they fit the usual criteria for Level 1 or 2 systems. However, they often have intersections, and many manuals advise against using the systems on roads with intersections. That’s because the systems don’t react to traffic lights or stop signs and can have trouble detecting stopped vehicles ahead and avoiding cross traffic. They also can have trouble staying within the lane through intersections.\nThe Evoque’s adaptive cruise control was on for 7 percent of nonfreeway principal arterial miles. Eleven percent of the post-update S90 nonfreeway principal arterial miles involved Pilot Assist.\nThere was wide variation in use of the systems, with some drivers not using them at all and some using them a lot. One Evoque driver drove 41 percent of nonfreeway principal arterial miles with adaptive cruise control, and one post-update S90 driver used Pilot Assist for 30 percent.\nShare this:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-23'),

That, in turn, means even fewer carbon emissions from your public utility. And as part of energy management systems, electric cars themselves (their traction batteries) could potentially help serve as flexible energy-storage buffers and pinch-hitters.\nConsidering Tesla’s acquisition of the much-hyped SolarCity in 2016, you might think that the electric carmaker would have quite the command of the market.\nSolarCity\nIt’s quite the opposite, and a new report from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie lends some context to the slide. Looking at the first quarter of 2019, Sunrun has an 11-percent market share while Vivint Solar has 7.6 percent and Tesla (SolarCity) is in third place, at 6.3 percent. It’s quite a turn from three years ago, when Tesla held a first place lead with more market share than the other two combined.\nWood MacKenzie expects the entire U.S. residential solar market to grow just three percent by the end of this year. In 2018 Tesla’s installations dropped 41 percent despite modest growth across the market as a whole.\nMarket share for home solar through Q1 - June 2019, Wood MacKenzie\nSolarCity reached a high of about 33 percent of the residential solar market in late 2015, the result of aggressive leasing programs and partnerships, such as with Home Depot.\nThe home-solar market hasn’t experienced much growth over the past several years. Another obstacle on the horizon is the Federal Investment Tax Credit for residential solar, which will sunset in 2022. And Wood MacKenzie says that it’s evidence that the market itself is segmenting.\nGeorge Parrotts home solar installation [Credit: George Parrott]\nIn Q1, Tesla’s total solar sales slumped by 36 percent versus the previous quarter and 38 percent versus year-ago levels.\nTesla cut prices of its solar systems late last year, and it announced another repositioning of its offerings in April. The company has said that its energy storage production was limited in 2018 by cell supplies, but it’s not clear whether this was related to the dip in solar sales.\nIn Tesla’s Q1 letter to its shareholders the company reported customers could now purchase solar and energy storage from its website “in standardized increments of capacity.”\nIt also said in the letter: “We aim to put customers in a position of cash generation after deployment with only a $99 deposit upfront. That way, there should be no reason for anyone not to have solar generation on their roof.”\nTesla bought SolarCity in 2016, at a cost of $2.6 billion, not counting the $3 billion of SolarCity debt it assumed. The original intent was to sell solar in its stores as well—something that hasn’t been a focus amid the push to deliver Model 3 sedans.\n“Tesla stepping away from being a growth driver for solar reaffirms our hypothesis that long-term national growth will continue to be driven by smaller local and regional players and less reliant on national players,” said the recent consultancy report.\nTesla Solar Roof\nThe pièce de résistance, Tesla’s long-awaited solar roof, has run into issues with manufacturing and cost. But in the company’s last quarterly financial call, CEO Elon Musk said that the company has a shot at the product costing the same as an existing roof. “This is actually quite a hard technology problem to have an integrated solar cell with a roof tile and have it look good and last 30 years,” he said.\nEven with a long list of products in the pipeline, like the Semi, the Pickup, the Roadster, Model Y, and the smaller car, it’s likely Tesla isn’t going to walk away from something still so potentially lucrative—or critical—to completing its ecosystem as just letting the sun shine in.\nTags:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-21');

He chose the 2018 Tesla Model X because its both fun and practical.\n\"This is my third Tesla —Ive had two Model S before this. When we made the move from Austin, Texas, to Hawaii, we figured we would go down to one vehicle, as opposed to having one family-car daily driver and then one thats a little bit more of a fun, speedy driver,\" he says with a laugh. \"We opted to try and just do everything all in one fell swoop with the Model X.\"\nDraiman loves the Model Xs acceleration and handling. \"I love the intelligent nature of the car, I love that the OS keeps updating on its own, giving you new features. I love some of those new features on the Autopilot that came with the last update,\" he says.\nSee all 9 photos9 photos\nHe only has a few issues with the car. \"For whatever reason, part of their design is to do a complete glass roof that doesnt have any regular sun visors. The sun visors in the Model X come from the side, and theres supposed to be enough tint on that big piece of glass to protect you completely and save you from glare,\" he says. \"It does—sort of—but you still end up trying to use these visors that come from the side and trying to position them six ways to Tuesday to get it just right.\"\nThe other thing he has an issue with is the Falcon Wing doors. \"Theyre really cool to look at, but theyre just not all that. Theyre functional, and the sensors on them work great for the most part, but its just not the most convenient thing. Sometimes in low-level garages, its just real hard to get passengers in and out. Its more aesthetic than it is functional, to be honest,\" he says, laughing.\nBut Draiman loves the Teslas spaciousness. \"I love the fact that we have extra space up front where there normally would be the engine compartment, and I love the integration of Google Maps and everything else that normally comes with a Tesla,\" he says. \"Im a tried and true Tesla owner and supporter.\"\nDraiman got the Tesla because he believes in doing what he can for the environment.\n\"Im a pretty strong conservationist. Its not that gas was crazy expensive when I got my first Tesla … but the convenience of being able to just plug it in at home and never having to go to a gas station or wait in lines for gas again,\" he says. \"Its more economical in terms of the money we spend energy-wise powering up the battery in the car versus what we would have spent on gas on a yearly basis; the difference is staggering.\"\nHe also gives the Tesla high marks for performance. \"With a combustion engine, youre never going to get the kind of acceleration and torque that you get in electric. Its just not going to ever happen. Its pretty amazing, the launch in these things, whether its the Model X, or I had two previous Models S, one was a P90D and the second one was a P100D ,\" he says.\nDraiman recalls times he enjoyed in the Model S when he lived in Austin. \"The 100D I had was the Ludicrous—it was 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds [ or even quicker, in our case ]. … I lived in a pretty affluent neighborhood there, and youd have guys in their Lamborghinis and Ferraris, and theyd always be sizing me up in my P100D, and Id smoke them every time,\" he says with a laugh. \"Tremendous satisfaction.\"\nSee all 9 photos9 photos\nDraiman also had other cars in Austin, which he sold when he moved. \"She was my favorite baby, a 69 Mustang GT 428 Cobra jet. That was my labor of love and my money pit,\" he says, laughing. \"I did all kinds of stuff to her: I put in a whole new updated transmission, sway bar, suspension, four-barrel Holley carb originally that I ended up converting to fuel injection, Hurst shifter, five-speed Tremec.\"\nAltbough the classic Mustang was a lot of fun, it was also expensive to maintain. \"As you know, with most classic cars, and particularly restomods, they tend to continue to bleed you over the course of time. You get to the point where now Im a family man and have my five-year-old and my wife, who doesnt really like the smell of the gas and the car with those big-block engines—its almost unavoidable to a certain extent. I just didnt really drive it as much as I used to, so I ended up selling it before I left Austin,\" he says.\nFor now, Draiman is enjoying the one-car lifestyle. \"For as often as Im on the road during the record cycle, its silly to have a second car just sitting here collecting dust,\" he says. \"When I get home, we both use the same car. I dont really have a whole lot of places to go without the family when Im here, so were all in it together.\"\nAlthough a second car doesnt seem necessary now, Draiman concedes that things might change down the road. \"I think once we go off cycle again, I might consider something. I was actually looking very lustfully at the Tesla Roadster ,\" he says, laughing. \"I dont know if I can justify dropping a quarter mil on it. Ill see.\"\nDraiman admits to being pretty levelheaded as far as his spending. \"The first crazy amount of money I ever spent on a car was my second Model S. After all the bells and whistles and Ludicrous mode and everything else, it was about 140 grand, which is a lot for me,\" he says. \"And that wasnt when I first got signed—that was only five, six years ago.\"\nCar he learned to drive in\nDraiman learned to drive in his moms mid- to late-1980s Ford Taurus, he says, \"way, way back in the day in Chicago.\" He learned in a neighborhood known as West Rogers Park on the north side of Chicago.\n\"My father taught me to drive. Hell always take credit for that, very, very proudly,\" he says, laughing. \"Hes a good driver. One of the reasons Im actually as good at parallel parking as I am is because of my father and his little techniques that he showed me. My mom didnt have a whole lot to do with teaching me to drive. In fact driving just simply isnt her favorite thing in the world—she likes to avoid it as much as possible.\"\nWhen Draiman was in high school he bought the Taurus from his parents, with money hed made working at jobs since he was 10. His first summer job was helping his father, who was in property management, by cleaning out old apartments.\n\"It was the most disgusting job you could possibly imagine because youd go into these old apartments and it looked like a scene from The Omen or something—maggots, rats, festering, disgusting, decaying food, and human matter. You cant even imagine how some people leave apartments when they go. It was my first large lesson in humility as a young boy,\" he says with a laugh.\nIt was important for Draiman to make money while he was in school. \"I had always worked in addition to going to school because having a car was something that was very, very important to me, once I was of age,\" he says, adding that his parents sold him the Taurus for about $4,000.\nBut Draiman didnt get to keep the car for as long as wouldve liked to. \"I remember one time after I had learned to drive, that poor thing, I had borrowed the car to go over to some friends of mine who were having little bit of a party a mile away from the house. I parked it on the street, and when I came out of the party at about 11 oclock at night, some truck had obliterated this thing. Half the car was gone, the left-hand side of the car was completely, no longer existing,\" he says, laughing. \"And I came out of the party, and my mouth went agape, and I looked at the thing, and Im like, How the hell am I going to explain this to my parents?\"\nPhotos of the band performing by Rafa Alcantara, studio photos by Travis Shinn.\nSee all 9 photos9 photos\nThe police came, and he filed an accident report. \"I said, Listen, I parked it right here, I didnt do anything. Somebody came, and it mustve been a large vehicle. They ended up finding the vehicle, but insurance companies can be pretty aggressive. Even if its not your fault when youre that age, its somehow still your fault,\" he says, laughing. \"It was a source of contention.\"\nWhen he lost the Taurus, it took a while before Draiman bought another car.\n\"I was just psychologically damaged from the obliteration of the car,\" he says, with a laugh, \"because I had gone through so much to finally get it, and finally had it, and then it ended up getting destroyed. After the car was obliterated, I didnt end up getting another one because once I graduated high school, I went to Israel to study in seminary for a year. Its not like I could bring the car with me.\"\nHe didnt get another car until he was about a year into university, when he got a two-door Ford Explorer . \"It was the smaller version back in the day; it wasnt the four-door,\" he says.\nFavorite road trip\n\"I used to drive back and forth from Chicago to L.A. quite a bit,\" Draiman says. \"I used to stay in Chicago while the weather was still decent and then run away to one of my other properties in Los Angeles when it got cold.\"\nHe drove to Los Angeles rather than fly because he was taking his beloved dog with him. \"I couldnt fly her at the time. She was a beautiful Akita named Lisa,\" he says. \"I still miss her terribly—shes no longer with us, unfortunately. But I used to drive her through all kinds of weather back then, back before I was a conservationist.\"\nThey drove in the Hummer H2 he had at that time. \"The complete antithesis, the complete opposite, the yin and yang, the ultimate symbolic gas-guzzler before I went completely responsible,\" he says. \"The funny thing is, with that thing there was so much stigma attached to it, it didnt really get much worse gas mileage than, say, a Yukon or any of the rest of those big SUVs, but it definitely got all the hate.\"\nOne time at his condo, Draiman found something that had been left for him. \"One of the other people in the building saw fit to leave a nice little note on the Hummer when it was sitting in the parking space: Dont you realize how ridiculous you look driving this gas-guzzler?\"\nBut what made the road trip between Chicago and Los Angeles so memorable was being with Lisa. \"When the weather was decent enough, wed have to make little pit stops for her to go do her business and for me to regain the strength. I usually did the trip in about two to four days, depending on the occasion,\" he says.\nHe also enjoyed the beautiful scenery. \"It was always great just having my little girl with me and seeing some of the sites. I used to always use Denver as a midway point, and going up into the mountains there is just gorgeous,\" he says. \"All these wonderful little places you can stop, little freshwater streams running right along the highway sometimes, really picturesque stuff. I always enjoyed that with her.\"\nDisturbeds Evolution album and tour\nDisturbed is on its European leg of the tour for its seventh studio album, Evolution, which ends in Athens on June 30, with a stop in Israel on July 2, before coming back to the States July 20 in Wisconsin.\n\"Its very exciting. About 75 percent of the [tour] run is sold out already, which is great. Were really looking forward to going back to Europe when the weather is actually decent as opposed to in the middle of winter when you dont want to venture out at all,\" Draiman says.\nBeing able to play around the world and perform in arenas isnt something Draiman takes for granted. At times, he metaphorically pinches himself.\n\"Every night we have those moments. Theres a campaign that were doing right now for the single that is currently number one on Active Rock Radio, called A Reason to Fight. Its raising awareness for suicide prevention and addiction, and weve partnered with a national suicide hotline and a number of other entities.\"\nDraimans work isnt just as a rock star. He also gets fulfillment connecting with his fans.\nOn this tour, for example, he recounts what has become a poignant moment for both the fans and himself. \"One of my favorite points of the evening, theres a point before we actually perform the song, we spend a little time reflecting on people weve lost, and we ask the audience if anyone has had any experience with addiction or depression, either themselves or in someone that they know or care about. And literally the entire arena every night raises their hands. And its this amazing moment of openness and understanding that always gets me—as Mike Myers would say back in the day—all verklempt tearing up,\" he says. \"It gets me every night, and I love being able to at least provide a safe space to people where they feel that they can at least be open enough to admit that theyve had dealings with it and to understand that they arent alone and that theres nothing to be ashamed of.\"\nDraiman sees his job on stage as a way to help lift others in the audience out of their daily lives. \"Every night that we go up there for two hours, its all about taking people from their day-to-day and empowering people and giving them the strength to transcend the bulls--t they have to deal with on a daily basis. We love what we do.\"\nFor more information about the tour and album, please visit disturbed1.com\n', 'TSLA', '2019-06-21'),

Energy company Zenobe has installed 78 stationery batteries and several charging stations at Stagecoach’s bus depot in Guildford, a town in southern England.\nThe electric buses in Guildford have been running since ADL and BYD delivered the electric vehicles this January as reported . However, Stagecoach ran into trouble at the depot when an upgrade of the onsite electric supply was threatening the viability of the electrification project since it would take 12 months to complete. This is where Zenobe came in.\nZenobe’s solution was to supply a stationary battery on site which incorporates a charging system that was installed within six weeks alongside a funding arrangement. The site at Guildford, not too far from South from London, is now a “battery-supported bus depot”. When speaking to the BBC, co-founder James Basden considered the introduction of electric bus fleets a “big generational shift that we’re trying to make happen now,” and with energy from renewables.\nThe installation for Stagecoach comprises 78 Tesla energy storage units that charge from the grid at off-peak prices and then charge the electric buses overnight. Stagecoach is running the 10.8-metre electric buses supplied by the BYD ADL partnership on park and ride services. The routes connect three car parks and a leisure centre with the town centre on six days a week.\nFor Zenobe, this is just one project. The company also launched a financing scheme this May as an add-on to the British government’s 48 million pound Ultra Low Emission Bus scheme (ULEB). The Zenobe EV scheme is worth up to £120 million from Zenobe Energy, and the company says it can be used alongside grants from the ULEB scheme.

Join the family and become a member today!\nA stone’s throw away from Giants stadium in downtown San Francisco parked an unassuming Midnight Silver Metallic Tesla Model 3, only this one was loaded with a real game-changer. Literally.\n“Thanks for coming out to check out the latest Beach Buggy Racing 2 ,” said game developer and co-founder of Vector Unit, Ralf Knoesel, to Tom Cross and I who had just arrived to witness Tesla’s first foray into the billion-dollar global gaming industry.\n“We’re really excited to show you guys what we’ve been working on,” a Tesla representative tells us, further explaining that the electric carmaker had been working with game studios like Vector Unit on developing fun and unique experiences for Tesla drivers and passengers alike. Experiences that would keep them entertained while they’re Supercharging or waiting in a car.\nSure, one can argue that there’s no replacement for the entertainment value that comes by way of Tesla’s in-car fart-on-demand app and its Classic Atari games, but they would be sorely mistaken.\nStay ahead of the curve and be the first to learn industry trends. Every week!\nFollow along as our team gives you their take on the biggest stories of the week.\nTesla Arcade has taken the richness and interactive gameplay of traditional mobile apps and gaming consoles and made them available directly inside the vehicle.\nLightning bolt powerups? Check. Ability to unlock secret boss levels? Absolutely. And do this while challenging a passenger (or perhaps, one day, other outside players) in multi-player mode? F-yeah! It’s all there. And this can all be experienced in full surround sound with active feedback from the vehicle’s steering wheel which doubles as a gaming controller. Playing Tesla Arcade is akin to gaming in the world’s most realistic simulator. Well. Because it is.\nThis is going to be a game-changer.

And that, my friend, is precisely what Tesla wants. You see, by zapping away time, the feeling of having to wait while charging your car becomes non-existent. More importantly, by creating an SDK that allows app developers to interface with the vehicle’s hardware, Tesla is planting the first seeds that will sprout an iTunes-like ecosystem to support our autonomous future. We just don’t know it yet.\nEntertain Me\nIf you think about it, it makes complete sense to have a rich library of apps and games inside a vehicle. This will especially be the case when self-driving cars become prevalent.\nIn a culture where human-to-human connections have given way to our digital overlords, having an extension of your life that includes your favorite video streaming platforms; your favorite business apps; and all of your favorite on-demand services (hi DoorDash, I’m looking at you) with you, while passing time during a commute inside a Tesla, feels like a no-brainer.\nBy the end of 2020, Elon Musk says Tesla owners will be able to add their vehicles to the company’s self-driving, ride-hailing “Robotaxi” network, which will enable Tesla and its vehicle owners to run a similar business model to Uber or Airbnb. Having entertainment will be paramount, filling the void of awkward conversations with strangers and enhancing the overall ride-sharing experience.\nWe’re at the cusp of a massive behavioral shift toward enhanced in-car lifestyles. Tesla’s opening of a gaming SDK that allows 3rd party developers to interface with the vehicle’s hardware is a pioneering moment for an entirely new industry that is about to awaken.\n“Tesla, order a deep dish pizza from Zachary’s for home delivery at 7 pm.”\nWhat do you think?

Various presentations, tutorials, workshops, demos, exhibitions, and social events promoting relevant topics are made available to attendees. This is the 32nd year for CVPR, taking place June 16-20 at the Long Beach Convention Center.\nTesla’s next-gen Roadster makes an appearance at CVPR 2019. | Image: LordOfBilkent/YouTube\nTesla’s next-gen Roadster makes an appearance at CVPR 2019. | Image: LordOfBilkent/YouTube\nAlong with Tesla’s Full Self-Driving capabilities, the next-generation Roadster may have some other features that would be of particular interest to CVPR attendees. CEO Elon Musk revealed last year that the tri-motor ‘supercar killer’ would be equipped with a feature an augmented mode that would enhance a driver’s abilities when operating the vehicle. “Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form,” he teased on Twitter in response to a question on whether the Roadster would have Autopilot. Augmented and mixed reality are computer vision problems at their core.\nFurthering speculation surrounding Augmented Mode was Tesla’s former Senior Manager, Design, Andrew Kim. Prior to working at Tesla, Kim worked for Microsoft, where he helped develop the HoloLens headset, a holographic computer that allows users to see and interact with holograms within an environment. Kim’s LinkedIn profile also noted that he was “leading experiences” in Tesla’s Model S, X, 3, Semi, Roadster 2, and Model Y, as well as “confidential future products and experiences.”\nElon Musk is notoriously associated with Marvel’s famous Tony Stark character, making the heads-up display connection between Roadster and the one featured in the Iron Man suit a highly anticipated prediction. Software and technical marvels aside, the next-generation Roadster will perform to the tune of 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds, the standing quarter-mile time in 8.9 seconds, and capable of achieving 620 miles of range thanks to a 200 kWh battery. Musk has also described a SpaceX package with cold-gas thrusters on several occasions which would push the performance of the electric car even further.\nTest drives for the new Roadster are estimated to start at the end of this year.

Had Kentucky’s Public Service Commission (PSC) decided otherwise, it would mean that EVCS charging costs would be regulated just like your home power bill. But it would also have had heavy consequences, deterring private investment in EV charging infrastructure.\nThe debate over utilities’ role in EV charging is a hot mess\nThe docket before the Kentucky PSC is an example of how elected leaders do a disservice to their constituents when they ignore EV charging infrastructure, and just leave it to the utility regulator. Instead of discussing how best to handle EV charging, a lot of time and resources are wasted on whether every last EVCS – from a Tesla Supercharger to a Main Street curb-side L2 charger – should be regulated as a utility. Almost no one wants that.\nBut is rejecting all utility-style regulation for every EVCS a good idea?\nUtilities support ratepayer protection, oppose Tesla Supercharger Network\nWhen you buy electricity from a utility, the rate is set by a tariff (price) schedule approved by the regulator. If the utility wants to raise prices to fund investment, they first have to seek permission from their regulator for the spending and corresponding rate hike.\nWhen you buy electricity from a private EVCS operator, prices can be raised dramatically overnight .\nThe Alliance for Transportation Electrification, a utility trade group, advocates for utilities owning and operating their own public EVCSs – “ensuring appropriate protections for electric ratepayers (including non-participants) as well as recognizing a robust role for non-utility service providers”. In a regulatory framework like this, utilities offer a “wholesale” tariff-rate for private EVCS operators and have their own “retail” tariff-rate they would charge at the utility’s own public EV charging stations.\nIn recent filings before utility commission dockets, the Alliance and its members have argued that they should only have to offer wholesale rates to EVCS operators who use the Open Charge Point Protocol and enable roaming between private network operators . This would exclude Tesla, meaning that Tesla would pay more for electricity for its Supercharger Network than operators who use OCPP .\nElectrek’s Take\nHow do you like the idea of living in an apartment where your electric meter is owned and operated by a private company, chosen by your landlord, that acts as a middleman between you and the utility, and has the power to mark-up your power rates in cahoots with your landlord? Would you like it more if they let you bundle your power bill with your cable TV or renter’s insurance? 😛\nI think we’re all glad that our meters are owned and operated by utilities subject to utility control.\nAt the same time, most EV drivers would likely agree that there’s a big place in the market for private operators like Electrify America, Tesla, and Chargepoint to partner with private businesses and offer flexible charging-billing solutions. For example, a grocery store giving an hour of free charging followed by a high charge for spot hogs who stay over an hour. Or Tesla offering free EVCS to hotels for the benefit of their customers.\nBut we shouldn’t be forced to choose between utility-level regulation for every last EVCS, or a dystopian company-town future. Kentucky’s Public Service Commission chose the latter for every EVCS in the state.\nIndeed, this choice punishes lower-income individuals. If you live in a house with a dedicated parking spot, you get to charge off your utility-meter and enjoy all the benefits of rate-payer protection. But if you live in an apartment with a common parking lot, then in Kentucky you’re at the mercy of private EVCS operators.\nAnd how about curbside charging on public streets? The privatization of public space is a growing problem in America. Chicago sold off their parking meters, and drivers are paying dearly . Public curbsides should not become the domain of private toll collectors.\nAt a minimum, utilities should be responsible for the operation and billing of EVCSs in multi-dwelling residence buildings and on public property, and users there should enjoy the same rate-payer protections afforded to homeowners.\nThe separate question of whether private networks like Tesla’s Supercharger network should benefit from wholesale EV rates is a tougher debate, with good points on both sides. But even if you oppose that, the difference between a wholesale EVCS rate and retail rate should be small, assuming the bulk of the cost isn’t in the physical EVCS station, but rather the ongoing power production and distribution (as well as conduit build-out).\nThe National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners has links to every American, Canadian, and many international utility regulators .

A September settlement agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission removed Musk from his chairman role while the company.\nTweet\nNeither Musk nor Tesla had to admit any wrongdoing under the settlement , but they couldnt deny wrongdoing, either.\nTeslas shares have tumbled 36% over the last year to a Thursday close of $238.30, wiping out roughly a third of its market value, which now stands at $42.7 billion.\nStill, its far from all bad for Tesla. The company reported two consecutive quarterly profits for the first time ever and it significantly increased production to about 7,000 vehicles per week.\nHowever, even many of Teslas positive milestones have been shrouded in controversy, including recent claims the company made on the safety of its Model 3 sedan that have been called into question by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nTesla didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.\nHeres a look at some of the highlights, and low lights, from Teslas turbulent year since the \"funding secured\" tweet and how the market reacted:\nStaying public\nWeeks after Musks initial tweet, he announced Tesla would remain a publicly traded company on Aug. 24.\nMusk, in a blog post , said the decision was based on the process being \"even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated\" and shareholders, \"in a nutshell,\" saying, \"please dont do this.\"\nTeslas shares fell by about 16% over those three weeks from their close of $379.57 a share the day Musk tweeted \"funding secured.\"\nwatch now\nSquawk on the Street\nWeed and the Joe Rogan show\nMusk stunned the world when the CEO smoked what appeared to be a joint on the Joe Rogan podcast during a wide-ranging interview on Sept. 6. The podcast sparked calls for his resignation and questions about his mental stability.\nIt also drove shares down 6.3% the next day.\nSEC lawsuit\nMusk was sued by the SEC on Sept. 27 , causing shares of the automaker to fall more than 13% in extended trading to roughly 30% below its 52-week high of $387.46 on Aug. 7, 2018.\nThe SEC complaint alleged that Musk issued \"false and misleading\" statements and failed to properly notify regulators of material company events.\nMusk called the allegations \"unjustified\" and said he \"never compromised\" his integrity.\n\"This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,\" Musk said in a statement to CNBC . \"I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\"\nTesla cars are delivered to a showroom in Brooklyn, New York on April 25, 2019.\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images\nSettlement reached\nTwo days after the SEC filing, the two sides announced a settlement that included $40 million in fines and Musk giving up his role as chairman for at least three years. The fines were split evenly between Musk and Tesla.\nThe companys shares jumped 17.35% the following day to $310.70 – the highest single-day gain in the past 12 months for the automaker.\nShortseller Enrichment Commission\nDays after settling the fraud charges against him, Musk mocked the SEC in an Oct. 4 tweet, calling the agency the \"Shortseller Enrichment Commission.\"\nShares of the automaker fell more than 2% after hours following the tweet, after already falling 4.4% while the markets were open.\nShares closed the following day down 7% at $261.95 per share.\nHistoric quarter\nThe company reported a surprise profit and big jump in revenue for the third quarter on Oct. 24, sending the stock soaring by more than 12%.\nMusk told analysts on a call it was an \"incredibly historic quarter\" for the company, which was still working on ramping-up production of the Model 3 sedan.\nNew chair\nTesla board member Robyn Denholm, the former COO and CFO at Australian telecom company Telstra, was named to replace Musk as chairperson of the company on Nov. 7.\nTesla shares closed the following day slightly up to $351.40 per share.\nRobyn Denholm\nSource: Telstra\nChina\nMusk and Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong on Jan. 6 celebrated the groundbreaking of the electric automakers first non-U.S. factory on the outskirts of Shanghai.\nProducing vehicles in China is expected to reduce costs from tariffs and ocean transport for Tesla.\nAccording to the company, the so-called Gigafactory in Shanghai \"will allow Tesla to localize production of Model 3 and future models sold in China, with plans to eventually produce approximately 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the initial phase and to ramp up to 500,000 vehicles per year when fully operational (subject to local factors including regulatory approval and supply chain constraints).\"\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (not pictured) at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing on January 9, 2019.\nMARK SCHIEFELBEIN | AFP | Getty Images\nLayoffs\nIn January, Tesla said it would cut 7% of its workforce.\nIn a Jan. 18 email to employees , Musk said the company faces a \"very difficult\" road ahead in its long-term goal to sell affordable renewable energy products, noting the company is younger than other players in the industry.\nThe January layoffs impacted at least 1,017 California employees, according to the companys filings with the states Employment Development Department\nShares of the company fell 13% to $302.26 per share after Musks email was reported.\nAnother profit\nTesla reported its second-consecutive quarterly profit during the fourth quarter on Jan. 30.

On that date, Musk tweeted — then revised — projections for full-year Tesla manufacturing numbers of \"around\" 50,000 units.\nAfter months of back-and-forth, the SEC and Musk reached an agreement over the use of his use of Twitter account. It detailed exactly what kind of information requires formal legal review before being shared.\nCredits into cash\nTesla has made over $1 billion in the last three years by selling emissions credits in the United States, including a reported deal in April with Fiat Chrysler. The Italian-U.S. carmaker agreed to pay Tesla hundreds of millions of euros to allow Tesla vehicles to be counted in its fleet to avoid fines for violating new European Union emission rules.\nThe reported deal did little to move the companys shares, which were trading around $270 a share at the time.\nBelow $200 a share\nTesla stock dipped below $200 a share in late-May as Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas cut the firms worst-case forecast on Teslas stock from $97 a share to just $10, citing concerns about the companys increased debt load and geopolitical exposure.\nOther analysts lowered their expectations, including Goldman Sachs , which slashed its price target a month later on concerns about demand for Tesla vehicles. UBS Colin Langan also c ut his price target by 20% in June to $160 a share and reiterated his sell rating.\nThe concerns followed several changes to Teslas business plans, including an announcement to shift to an online sales model that would result in many store closings and price cuts.\nTesla stock hit its lowest closing price in two and a half years on June 3 at $178.97 per share.\nNHTSA cease-and-desist\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent Musk a cease-and-desist letter in October regarding \"misleading statements\" made in a blog post that month about the Model 3 having \"the lowest probability of injury of all cars the safety agency has ever tested.\"\nThe NHTSA, which awarded the Model 3 an overall 5-star safety rating for the 2017 model, said it referred the matter to the Federal Trade Commissions Bureau of Consumer Protection, according to a copy of the letter, which was posted earlier this week on the legal transparency website PlainSite .\nVisitors look at a Tesla Model 3 during a press preview of the Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, northwest of Seoul, on March 28, 2019.\nJung Yeon-Je | AFP | Getty Images\nRebound\nTesla shares had rebounded in recent months to more than $260 per share before it missed second-quarter earnings estimates on July 24, sending shares tumbling more than 13% the next day.\nWhile discussing the earnings, many were surprised to hear that Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel, a co-founder of the company, would be leaving his post to become an advisor to the carmaker -- adding to a growing list of executive turnover at Tesla.\nCNBCs Lora Kolodny contributed to this article.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-08'),

Despite NHTSAs urging, the car company has so far declined to remove the blog post. The NHTSA documents were posted today on Plainsite.org , a website that promotes legal transparency.\nIn response to questions about how the company uses crash-test results in marketing its vehicles, Tesla referred CR to its letter to NHTSA from October.\nNHTSA, in a written response to CR, reiterated its commitment to providing crash-test results for consumers to make informed decisions about safety. It didnt respond to specific CR questions about Teslas continued claim or any next steps the agency plans in response.\nTeslas safety claims are under scrutiny in part because of its influence in the auto industry. As a leader in battery-electric vehicles and advanced technology, such as its Autopilot suite of driver-assistance features, Tesla is seen as a leader in some of the most important trends shaping the future of the auto industry.\nNHTSA vs. Tesla\nThe released documents depict an ongoing struggle between regulators and the upstart electric-car maker over what the agency alleges is misleading marketing of Tesla vehicles.\nIt isnt the first time Tesla has been criticized by NHTSA over the characterization of crash tests. In 2013, Tesla backed off claims that its Model S sedan deserved 5.4 stars on NHTSAs five-star scale. (CRs Friedman was deputy administrator at NHTSA at the time.) Consumer groups and safety advocates also have criticized Tesla for overhyping the capabilities of technologies, such as the Autopilot driver-assistance system and the companys \"Full Self Driving\" feature.\nTesla made its Model 3 claim in an Oct. 7 blog last year, saying that the Model 3 sedan has \"the lowest probability of injury of all cars the safety agency has ever tested.\"\nIn response, NHTSA made a public statement on Oct. 9 that said it doesnt distinguish safety performance beyond its star ratings and that there is no \"safest\" vehicle among the vehicles with 5-star ratings. A cease-and-desist letter followed Oct. 17, saying that Tesla was violating the agencys guidelines for how companies are to convey crash-test data to the public. The agency also said it was referring the matter to the Federal Trade Commission, which investigates deceptive marketing.\nNHTSAs letter notes that it was the second time it was investigating Tesla for publishing what it deemed to be misleading information about crash tests.\nIn the Model 3 case, NHTSA said it was inaccurate to compare overall safety scores of vehicles with different weights.\n\"A number of NHTSA studies have evaluated the impact of vehicle mass on fatality rates, and these potential safety differences are not reflected in a vehicles front crash-test results,\" NHTSAs chief counsel, Jonathan Morrison, said in the letter. \"It is impossible to say based on the frontal crash test results or the Overall Vehicle Scores whether the Model 3 is safer than other 5-Star rated vehicles.\"\nTeslas Oct. 31 response showed that the company had no intention of backing down. In fact, the blog is still available on the companys website. A Tesla spokeswoman said Wednesday that the company wouldnt comment beyond its letter to NHTSA.\nIn that letter, Tesla emphasized that it was using NHTSAs own publicly available data for nearly 1,000 vehicles. Based on that, the Model 3s overall vehicle safety score of 0.38 translated into an overall probability of injury of 5.7 percent—better than any other vehicle.\n\"Teslas blog statements are entirely based on actual results and NHTSAs own calculations for determining relative risk of injury and probability of injury,\" Al Prescott, the companys deputy general counsel, said in the letter. \"We do not see a reason to discontinue use of our safety blog or these statements as long as no other vehicle surpasses the Model 3 Long Range RWDs Vehicle Safety Score and overall probability of injury.\"\nAt Consumer Reports, safety is factored into the Overall Score given for each car we test. It is one of four key components of the Overall Score, along with road test, reliability, and owner satisfaction.\nThe safety component factors crash-test data from IIHS and NHTSA, if theyve been conducted. CR gives extra credit to vehicles that have the advanced safety systems that have been shown to reduce crashes, injuries, and deaths, but only when theyre offered as standard equipment across all trim levels of a model. Those systems include automatic emergency braking (AEB), forward collision warning (FCW), pedestrian detection, and blind spot warning. We deduct points if a vehicle gets an inferior rating in a federal or IIHS crash test. And we deduct points from monostable gear selectors that lack fail-safes (such as automatically returning to Park or engaging the parking brake when the engine is shut off to prevent the possibility of rollaway crashes).\nNHTSA 5-Star Cars\nThe Tesla Model 3 and Model X are in rare company, with only 10 current vehicles achieving five stars across the board in NHTSA crash tests. The Model S has not been tested in recent years, but it previously achieved five stars in the front and side crash tests and rollover evaluation.\nThere is a significant number of models that havent been crash-tested by NHTSA, and some other models havent been put through every test, factors possibly contributing to the short list of 5-star vehicles.\nAlthough Tesla vehicles have scored high on the NHTSA tests, other vehicles have done better on certain IIHS tests. For example, the 2017 Model S earned an \"acceptable\" score on the small-overlap frontal crash test. IIHS also deemed the Model Ss headlights to be poor.\nThe ratings boxes below share highlights from Consumer Reports tests and surveys for the group of 10 vehicles that achieved five stars across the board in NHTSA crash tests.\nQuick Take\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07');

REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo\nThe lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Northern California federal court alleges fraud and seeks class action status for the potentially “thousands” of such Model S and X owners around the world who have seen the range of their older-generation batteries suddenly curtailed, some by as much as 40 miles (64 km).\nThe lost range has been a hot topic since May on online owner forums, such as TeslaMotorsClub.com, in which many owners detail how their battery range has fallen. Some users bought more expensive models because they offered greater range. They say Tesla took this away with the software update, thereby devaluing the car, limiting the distance they can travel and forcing them to recharge more frequently.\nPlaintiff David Rasmussen’s 2014 Model S 85 lost battery capacity equivalent to about 8kWh but was told by Tesla the degradation was normal, the lawsuit says.\nA Tesla spokesperson said the company’s priority was to deliver the best possible customer experience with the highest regard for safety.\n“A very small percentage of owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles may have noticed a small reduction in range when charging to a maximum state of charge following a software update designed to improve battery longevity,” Tesla said.\nIt added that it was working to mitigate the impact on range for affected owners and “have been rolling out over-the-air updates to address this issue since last week.”\nThe issue first came to light in May. After a Model S caught fire in Hong Kong, Tesla said that out of an overabundance of caution it was revising charge and thermal management settings on Model S and X vehicles via an over-the-air software update. The goal was “to help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity,” it said. In June, it said it planned to improve the impact of the software update after some owners complained.\nSome owners who have seen their cars no longer able to charge to 100% have sought redress through arbitration, while at least three have sold their cars, according to Teslamotorsclub.com forum posts. Others have disabled their Wi-Fi to avoid any software updates that could affect their range.\n“Under the guise of ‘safety’ and increasing the ‘longevity’ of the batteries of the Class Vehicles, Tesla fraudulently manipulated its software with the intent to avoid its duties and legal obligations to customers to fix, repair, or replace the batteries of the Class Vehicles, all of which Tesla knew were defective, yet failed to inform its customers of the defects,” wrote the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit points to a recent spate of Tesla battery fires, and claims that instead of informing its customers about a potential fire risk, the company “chose to go behind the backs of its customers and use software updates and throttling of the battery to avoid liability.”\nIn its Vehicle Safety Report published on its website, Tesla says vehicle fires are “exceptionally rare” and from 2012 to 2018 there was approximately one Tesla vehicle fire for every 170 million miles traveled. It compared that with data from the National Fire Protection Association and the U.S. Department of Transportation showing a vehicle fire for every 19 million miles traveled in the United States. Those entities measure fires in all vehicles, not just Teslas.\nIn May, Tesla said its vehicles were 10 times less likely to experience a fire than a gas car. It said that in its investigation of the Hong Kong fire, it found that only a few battery modules were affected and the majority of the battery pack was undamaged.\nOne owner, Nick Smith of Orlando, Florida, said in an interview he has been frustrated by poor customer service by Tesla, with sluggish response to his calls and emails and being kept in the dark over the true root of the problem and what will be done to remedy it.\n“It’s as if you take your car to the shop and you have a 20 gallon tank but now you have a 10 gallon tank without your knowledge or permission,” Smith said in an interview.\nSmith’s 2013 Model S P85 will no longer charge past 90% following the software update. Tesla told him the loss was due to normal regular battery degradation, he said.\nThe batteries in question carry an eight-year warranty.\nReporting by Alexandria Sage in San FranciscoEditing by Matthew Lewis and Cynthia Osterman\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-08'),

Two small explosions occurred within a few seconds of each other and the metal frame of the vehicle was all that remained after the fire, TV footage showed.\nRussias RIA state news agency website posted a video showing the car driving in the left-hand lane of Moscows ring road, known as the MKAD, before crashing into a tow truck parked by a safety fence that separates the carriageway from oncoming traffic.\nThe accident took place at around 2100 Moscow time (1800 GMT).\nTretyakov, a financial market expert and the head of Arikapital investment company, said he broke his leg in the incident, while his two children suffered only bruises. They all escaped from the vehicle.\nTesla was not immediately available for a comment on the incident outside normal business hours.\nReporting by Andrey Ostroukh; Additional reporting by Rishika Chatterjee; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Lisa Shumaker and Keith Weir\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

Tesla also recently rejiggered the Model S and Model X lineups , cutting prices and simplifying the trim levels to include only Long Range and Performance configurations. All Model S and Model X trim levels include free unlimited Supercharging, according to the companys website, while no version of the Model 3 includes the credits.\nThis content is imported from poll.

Musk said he wanted Tesla employees to remain shareholders, as is the practice, with options to periodically sell shares and exercise options to buy.\n\"Basically, Im trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible,\" he wrote.\nAnother update on taking Tesla private\nThe details trickle out.\nMARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images\nOn August 13, almost a week after the surprising announcement, Musk finally laid out the \"secured\" funding source: Saudi Arabia.\nThe kingdoms sovereign wealth fund had been interested in a Tesla stake \"going back two years,\" Musk said in another blog post. At the time, the fund owned a roughly 5% stake in the company on public exchanges.\n\"I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,\" Musk said. \"This is why I referred to \"funding secured\" in the August 7th announcement.\"\nHowever, funding was not secured.\n\"I continue to have discussions with the Saudi fund, and I also am having discussions with a number of other investors, which is something that I always planned to do since I would like for Tesla to continue to have a broad investor base,\" Musk said. \"It is appropriate to complete those discussions before presenting a detailed proposal to an independent board committee.\"\nThat didnt sit well with investors. By the end of the day, Teslas share price had fallen to 8% below its peak when the plan was announced.\nTo close the blog post, Musk said a special committee was being formed by the companys board. He said that if his plan was approved by the directors, it would be presented to shareholders.\nEnter Grimes and Azealia Banks\nAnd then a curveball.\nReuters\nBanks told Business Insider amid the flurry of Tesla news that week that she had spent the weekend at Musks house.\nThe rapper posted on Instagram that she \"waited around all weekend while Grimes coddled her boyfriend.\"\nIn another Story, she wrote that \"staying in Elon musks house has been like a real like episode of Get Out.\"\n\"They bring me out there on the premise that we would hang and make music,\" Banks later told Business Insider. \"But his dumbass kept tweeting and tucked his dick in between his ass cheeks once shit hit the fan.\"\nShe added: \"I saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his ass after that tweet. He was stressed and red in the face.\"\nA representative for Musk told Business Insider in an email that \"Elon has never even met Ms. Banks or communicated with her in any way\" but did not deny that Banks had stayed at one of Musks properties over the weekend.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07'),

Its the first electric car from one of the worlds most accomplished and acclaimed performance vehicle manufacturers, the product of more than five years work and an investment of more than $1 billion. Its also the first electric car that will sorely test the loyalties of the Teslarati.\nThis much is clear after an exhilarating ride along some of Californias best driving roads with Taycan vehicle line director Robert Meier at the wheel. It took just a handful of corners to realize that Meier, a former Rolls-Royce aerospace engineer who joined Porsche to work on the V-10-powered Carrera GT, is pretty handy behind the wheel of a fast car. And that the Taycan performs and handles … like a real Porsche.\nSee all 10 photos10 photos\nOur test mule was a lightly disguised preproduction car. Hidden under sheets of cladding was a fully finished interior we cant talk about until later this month. I can tell you the steering wheel is straight out a 992-series 911, though.\nMeier is very tight-lipped on the details but confirms the car is top-of-the-range spec. That means a dual-motor powertrain with somewhere north of 600 hp, and, as on the top-spec Panamera Turbo S, Porsches PCCB carbon-ceramic brakes and rear-wheel steering will be standard. Wheels are 21 inches. Front tires are 265/35; rears are 305/30. Our car runs Goodyear Eagles, though Michelins will also be available.\nArchitecturally, the Taycan, which is built on the Porsche-developed J1 BEV platform, follows the skateboard layout used by Tesla , Jaguar , and Audi , with a central underfloor battery pack and e-motors mounted at each axle. In terms of size, its slightly smaller overall than a Panamera, with a slightly shorter wheelbase, but the more compact packaging of the e-powertrain—and what looks to be an innovative approach to the shape of the battery pack in the rear floor area—makes it feel every bit as roomy inside. Its a genuine four-seater.\nUp front, the view out the windshield is very reminiscent of a 911, with two rounded fender tops peeking over the cowl. In fact, says Meier, the driving position is identical to that of Porsches iconic sports car.\nAs we roll out of town, the Taycan impresses with low noise levels and a compliant ride. Theres a distant whirr from the e-motors, and some muted tire noise over coarse surfaces, but its all well suppressed. The Taycan uses the same three-chamber air suspension and 48-volt active anti-roll system as top-spec Panameras and the Bentley Continental GT , though theyve been retuned to cope with the Taycans weight and dynamic performance targets. It feels sportier, but theres the same oily cadence to the primary ride motions as in the other two cars.\nSee all 10 photos10 photos\nWe turn off into the hills, onto a quiet, twisty two-lane, away from the traffic. Meier twists the steering wheel-mounted controller out of Normal mode, through Sport, and into Sport +. The e-motor whirr changes pitch, becoming deeper, more earnest. Its purely showbiz; the e-motors dont operate any differently. But as in internal combustion Porsches, the accelerator response is sharpened, theres more meat in the steering feel, and the suspension stiffens its sinews.\nMeier floors it.\nIts like being fired out of a railgun. The black Porsche lunges at the horizon, the rate of acceleration one long, linear surge of weapons-grade thrust. Corner! Meiers hard on the brakes, the monster carbon-ceramic rotors feeling every bit as predictable and precise as in a 911, and turns in. I detect mild understeer on corner entry, then a perceptible weight transfer as what is clearly a strongly rear-biased powertrain delivers a mountain of instant-on torque to those wide rear tires.\nThe next few miles are epic, Meier quick and neat behind the wheel as this biggish Porsche sedan appears to compress time and space with the insouciant ease of a GT2 RS. Braking, turn-in response, midcorner balance, post-apex traction: the Taycan stays flat, grips tenaciously, and feels instantly responsive. It soaks up big midcorner heaves and sharp-edge stutters with aplomb, and the body feels as tight as a drum, despite the massive loads coming through the suspension. I sense the weight on the transitions—batteries are heavy—but Meier confirms the center of gravity is lower than that of a 911.\nEven from the passenger seat, its obvious the Taycan sets a new benchmark for electric car dynamics. It makes a hard-driven Tesla Model S feel loose and skittish. But the big question everyones going to ask is: Whats the range? Meier wont quote EPA numbers, but a peek at the instrument panel at the end of the day suggested our mule would cover at least 235 miles despite being driven at times like it was on a qualifying lap at Le Mans.\nSee all 10 photos10 photos\nWell wait until we get our hands on a production Taycan before we make final judgement, but this first acquaintance suggests Porsche has created an electric vehicle with impressive performance and handling, and one thats remarkably efficient. Other than saying the e-motors were designed to deliver both power and efficiency, Meier refuses to be drawn on how. But he smiles when I mention feeling what appeared to be gearshift under hard acceleration.\nLift off the accelerator, and the Porsche coasts down the road; unlike other EVs, theres no driving strategy where kinetic energy is harvested and sent back to the battery. There is no one-pedal driving mode, or even mild liftoff regen. \"We let kinetic energy move the car when possible,\" Meier admits. \"Sending it back to the battery means energy losses because the process cannot be 100 percent efficient.\" As in the Audi E-Tron , normal braking via the brake pedal is achieved purely by modulating regen to a certain g threshold, above which the calipers start clamping those giant carbon-ceramic rotors.\nShould Tesla be worried? Absolutely. Even from the passenger seat, its clear the Porsche is dynamically superior in every way. And if the numbers weve seen hold up under our testing, go-fast Teslas such as the Model S 100D may not have a decisive range advantage over the Taycan, especially when driven hard. Combine that with noticeably better build quality—even on the preproduction car—and the cachet of that Porsche badge, and it all adds up to one thing: The Taycan is a game-changer.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-11'),

A posting on the Norwegian classified ads website Finn lists a 2018 Tesla Model S sedan thats been converted into an all-electric hearse, complete with an extended rear cabin large enough to fit a casket.\nThe Tesla hearse, which is currently listed for sale for 1.99 million Swedish Krona (the equivalent of about $208,000 USD), was built by a 50-year-old Norwegian man named Jan Erik Naley, according to the Finn posting. Naley told a Norwegian auto website that the electric vehicle is actually the fourth Tesla hes converted into a hearse, and he already sold the previous three versions.\n(For a price comparison, in the U.S., the website SpecialtyHearse.com sells used hearses like a 2018 Lincoln Federal Hearse, for up to $85,900 , while a custom-built hearse from the likes of Rosewood Classic Coaches in Arkansas will reportedly cost up to $105,000.)\nPhotos of Naleys creation can be found on the Finn posting as well as on the website for his business, Karmoy Bilsenter:\nSource: Jan Erik Naley/Karmoy Bilsenter\nSource: Jan Erik Naley/Karmoy Bilsenter\nNaley says hes spent several years converting all types of cars into hearses for local funeral homes, including hearses made from Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac SUVs . Two Norwegian funeral homes asked him about converting an electric Tesla into a hearse, he says, and the first one he designed took two years to complete. Naley adds that he works with an auto factory in the Netherlands to construct the vehicles.\nVIDEO0:0000:00\nMake It\nMuch of the work comes from cutting the car in half and extending it by more than 31 inches in length (to ensure there is room for a casket) while adding a wagon roof and rear door that opens into a totally remodeled interior. The inside walls of the Tesla hearse are heavily padded to accommodate the cargo, and the retractable interior floor can be extended out of the rear door to form a platform for loading a casket.\nSource: Jan Erik Naley/Karmoy Bilsenter\nNaley is mostly focused on selling his electric hearses in Norway, he tells the local auto website, though hes received interest from prospective buyers in other countries, as well. \"It is mainly the Norwegian market I focus on. Then we will see what happens afterwards,\" he says. \"But I have already received requests for Tesla deliveries to both Finland and Iceland.\"\nPreviously, a Dutch limousine company called RemetzCar has built and sold Tesla cars converted into hearses . And, in June, YouTube star Simone Giertz posted a video showing how she and a group of engineers converted a Tesla Model 3 sedan into a pickup truck . Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising that a Tesla pickup is in the works and could be unveiled this year.\nDont Miss:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-09');

If r is small or negative, then the graph, while still an exponential, isnt nearly as impressive:\n( source )\nRevenues, Unit Sales & ASP\nLets begin by looking at TSLAs overall revenues and revenue growth numbers. Ive plotted the data two ways, first as quarterly revenues on a linear scale, and second as trailing twelve month revenues on a log scale. To be sure, the TTM chart shows a relatively linear trend on the log scale which is indicative of steady growth rates and an exponential curve as Elon points out.\nHowever, looking at the quarterly linear chart shows that revenues peaked in Q4 of 2018, plunged in Q1 of 2019 and still havent recovered by Q2 of 2019. So which is it? Does the TTM chart better represent TSLAs growth track or is the quarterly data more predictive of future performance?\nTo answer this question more granularity is needed, so Ive created four other plots to better parse the data.\nData by YCharts\nData by YCharts\nFirst Ive plotted monthly US sales and monthly European sales broken out by the S, X and Model 3. (Source data here .) Since monthly data is lumpy, Ive also plotted the trailing three month average of sales as the line for each set of points.\nNot surprisingly, volumes of the Model 3 have continued to soar, while both the Model X and Model S have dropped. Elon Musk even alluded to this on the recent conference call , though his pronouncements contradict earlier predictions in which the S and the X would remain important revenue drivers (with my emphasis):\nColin Rusch\nOkay. And can I have a follow-up question around Model S and Model X saturation? Obviously you guys have some ideas around how big that market is? How should we be thinking about sustainable volumes and pricing on those volumes?\nObviously were seeing some lower numbers here and I think thats a core element of whats going on with the story that as we see pricing drop and volumes drop what are the right numbers to think about you guys from a planning standpoint in terms of sell through on both the Model S and Model X?\nElon Musk\nYes. I think its probably too much focused on S and X . The S and X -- they are nice, but theyre not -- and its like without them we couldnt spell sexy. So the main reason, well not the main reason, but a reason is we want to keep spelling sexy. So, that is a reason, I should say not the main reason, but a reason to keep going with the S and X.\nBut the story for Tesla in future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y and I think like my guess is like long-term sales of – long term meaning, a couple of years I think. The demand for -- sales demand for 3 is like on the order of three quarters of a million units a year, and its probably 1.25 million per year for Model Year, so they combined is like maybe two million from those two vehicles, and then S/X is like there may be 80,000 to 100,000 a year. So its like 4% or 5% of the volume in 3 and Y. And then you could throw like a truck in there, pickup truck and a semi, but it just gets smaller and smaller. So they are great products, but they’re -- from a volume standpoint, theyre not all that important in the long-term.\nBut if Model 3 is the story, and its volumes are increasing, why have revenues declined the past two quarters. To answer this we have to look at ASPs.\n(Authors graph, data sourced here )\n(Authors graph, data sourced here )\nIn the next two graphs, Ive plotted TSLA worldwide deliveries by quarter and then the automotive revenue divided by the number of deliveries. This latter metric is a proxy for ASP though its slightly noisy due to TSLA including ZEV credits in its automotive revenues.\nHeres where I think we can answer the question of exponential growth or not. This past quarter saw the highest unit volumes ever, yet automotive revenues fell short of the peak set in Q4 of 2018. The reason is that ASPs fell due to the mix of S/X to Model 3s and due to the fact that Q4 benefited from being able to preferentially supply the highest grade, most expensive trims for the Model 3. Thats a dynamic that will never repeat, indeed the converse will occur: TSLA will not only have to drop prices and supply lower trim configurations, but it will also have to engage in marketing and discounting to do so! Similarly, Model S/X sales wont ever match those of Q4 when the federal subsidy was higher than it is now. That, in summary, is why I think weve seen peak TSLA revenues excluding another spike in revenues for a quarter or so when TSLA can use the same approach with the Model Y (and dont be surprised when TSLA downplays the importance of the Model 3 during the Model Y launch).\nExpanding to China will help maintain current sales levels, but it wont in my opinion, lead to overall \"exponential\" revenue growth.\n(Authors graph sourced from TSLA update letters )\n(Authors graph sourced from TSLA update letters )\nCompetition in the Truck Market\nOn July 23, a somewhat underappreciated player in the EV space, Ford ( F ), posted a blog entry where it described its plans to produce an all electric F-150 truck (on the heels of an all electric Mustang). No availability dates were given, but the post includes an embedded video showing a prototype F-150 EV pulling a 1.25M lbs of rail cars, so this isnt just a concept.\n(image source )\nIndeed, F is ramping up its efforts in the space as attested to by this excerpt from the post (my emphasis):\nThis demonstration showcases our commitment to remain the clear leader in trucks as well as to highlight our commitment to the future of electric vehicles. We’ve already announced plans to bring an F-150 hybrid to market that can act as a mobile generator.\nAnd, as a reminder, we are also working feverishly on our plans to reveal our fully electric, Mustang-inspired SUV. Get ready. No games. This isn’t about compliance. We are backing our plans with countless hours of research and testing to ensure we deliver an electric experience that wows — and wins — customers. And we are going to have incredible charging plans that get you where you need to go with ease and peace of mind. But more on that later.\nSo not only will F compete with TSLA on the truck front, but it is also planning to have \"incredible charging plans\", further offsetting TSLAs current supercharging network advantage.\nRivian is also planning to launch an off-road capable truck and SUV by the end of 2020.\nThe R1T truck (image source )\nThe R1S SUV (image source )\nThe companys FAQ has some interesting tidbits, including an expected 400+ mile range for the largest battery pack, plans for its own charging network (focused on making \" sure there are stations near the wild places our drivers want to go\"), and real off-road capabilities.\nThe F-150 and the Rivian will likely get to market before TSLAs truck, so they may have first mover advantage in that space.\nExecutive Departures\nBusiness Insider does a good job of keeping track of all the TSLA executive turnover , heres just the people who have departed in 2019, punctuated by CTO JB Straubel (who will remain as an advisor):\nJanuary 2019 — Todd Maron, general counsel: LinkedIn profile does not list next position\nJanuary 2019 — Charles Mwangi , senior director of engineering: LinkedIn profile says he is working at an unnamed startup\nFebruary 2019 — Cindy Nicola, vice president of global recruiting: LinkedIn profile does not list next position\nFebruary 2019 — Dane Butswinkas, general counsel: returning to his trial practice at the firm Williams & Connolly\nMarch 2019 — Deepak Ahuja, CFO: retired\nMarch 2019 — Praveen Arichandran, director of growth: joining Citizen in April to lead growth.\nApril 2019 — Karl Wagner, senior director of global security: PTSD and suicide-prevention advocacy\nMay 2019 — Dave Arnold, senior director of global communications: LinkedIn profile does not list next position.\nJune 2019 — Felicia Mayo, vice president of human resources and head of diversity: LinkedIn profile does not list next position.\nJune 2019 — PeterHochholdinger, vice president of production: vice president of manufacturing at Lucid Motors.\nJune 2019 — Steve MacManus, vice president of interior & exterior engineering: senior director at Apple\nJuly 2019 — Jan Oehmicke, vice president of Tesla Europe: LinkedIn profile does not list next position.\nJuly 2019 — JB Straubel, chief technology officer: did not announce his next position, but said he will continue to advise Tesla\nI think this list continues to support the idea that management (and its indifference towards shareholders, see Solarcity bailout) is the number one reason to stay short TSLA.\nConclusion\nI remain short TSLA due to the five reasons given at the outset of the article. In particular, recent revenue trends suggest that the exponential growth narrative is dead; competition continues to emerge and executive turnover remains unabated. TSLA is therefore still a \"favorite\" short as well as being a great trading stock.\nThis article was written by\n4.63K Followers\nFollow\nIm a private trader interested in both long and short ideas.

It’s projected to open by December.\nVivianna, left, and her husband, Peter, right, in front of one of their two Teslas at their Moorestown, Burlington County, N.J. home. Read more Vivianna van Deerlin\nUpdated\non Aug 7, 2019, 12:47 p.m. ET\nVivianna and Peter Van Deerlin both own Teslas, recently taking a cross-country trip in one of them from their Moorestown home to San Francisco.\nFinding a charge was easy because the electric vehicle’s onboard computer plotted all the charging stations on their route, including those at hotels.\n“We have become a full electric car family and we don’t have any conventional gas cars,” said Vivianna, a pathology and laboratory medicine professor at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\nAs president of the Delaware Valley Tesla Owners Club , she is pleased at the budding partnership between Tesla and Wawa to offer charging stations — though she still charges her car most nights at home.\nAdvertisement\nLori Bruce, a spokesperson for Wawa, said the company now has 16 stores with Tesla Superchargers with plans to double that by the end of 2020. Wawa’s newest store planned with Tesla Superchargers is being built on Route 73 in Maple Shade, next to Uno Pizzeria & Grill. Bruce said it’s projected to open by December.\nThe convenience store chain began opening charging stations in August 2017. The Tesla Supercharger connector is proprietary, so Wawa does not offer charging for other electric vehicles, except at one store outside the Philly region.\nBruce said the company decided to the install the fast-charging stations after requests by Tesla customers.\nA typical Wawa charging site has eight Tesla Superchargers. The stations add about 150 miles of driving range per 15 minutes of charging. The company has rolled out its latest charger that will charge at a rate of 75 miles of range per 5 minutes of charging, though it’s not yet available on the East Coast.\nThe latest Teslas have a range of up to 370 miles — slightly farther than the distance from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh — when fully charged.\nAs of now, New Jersey is Wawa’s top market for the chargers. In the immediate Philadelphia area, however, Wawa’s charging offerings are few , with currently only a handful of locations in Delaware and South Jersey. None is in Philadelphia or its immediate western suburbs. And none is in Pennsylvania, though Bruce said that will change.\nCurrently, Wawa Tesla charging sites are located in:\nNew Jersey — Florence, Woodbridge, Paulsboro, Kearny, Parsippany, and Barnegat.\nDelaware — Lewes, Claymont, and Dover.\nVirginia — Chester and Fredericksburg.\nFlorida — Pinellas Park, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Riviera Beach (West Palm Beach).\nMost electric vehicles can’t handle the amount of fast charging that a Tesla is capable of. Tesla said it makes up roughly 80% of the overall electric vehicle market that can take what’s known as a DC fast charge.\nCurrently, the Pennsylvania-based Wawa offers only one non-Tesla charging station that uses the Electrify America network. Electrify America offers a broader range of connections, including CCS , CHAdeMO , and J1772™ connectors. The Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric vehicles, for example, use CHAdeMO connectors.\nTesla has started offering an adapter at its charging stations that also works with CHAdeMO connectors.\nBut it’s clear that the demand for Tesla chargers is increasing. The company reported record deliveries of 95,356 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019, surpassing its previous record of 91,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2018. It expects to produce 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year.\nOverall, Tesla now has about 6,500 Superchargers in North America and plans to rapidly expand its electric vehicle charging offerings, though most owners charge their vehicles at home each night through 120- or 240-volt outlets. Most owners say it’s no problem to combine the network of Superchargers and other charging locations on long trips.\nOne big factor that could play into charger locations: how welcoming each state is to electric vehicles.\nDoug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, said environmentalists in the Garden State welcome the growth of the charging stations, but would like to see more stations that work with all electric vehicles.\nHe’s supporting legislation in New Jersey that would establish statewide programs, procedures, and rules to bolster development of widespread public charging infrastructure that will work for all electric vehicles by 2025.\nNew Jersey also offers a sales tax exemption on the purchase of a zero-emissions vehicle. That can amount to thousands of dollars on, say, the purchase of a Tesla Model 3 for $50,000.\n“I think it’s indicative electric vehicles are increasingly becoming more mainstream,” O’Malley said. “But it’s a chicken-and-the-egg situation. We need more electric vehicle charging stations.”\nO’Malley said many people are reluctant to buy electric cars without the assurance they will be able to charge them in what’s known as “range anxiety” — even though electric vehicles are gaining more range each year on a single charge.\nFor example, O’Malley said, there are 500,000 people living in Camden County, possessing tens of thousands of vehicles. But there are only 18 public charging stations, including one of the newest at the county’s boathouse at Cooper River in Pennsauken.\nIn Pennsylvania, David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, notes that the commonwealth also has proposed legislation, known as the Pennsylvania Clean Transportation Infrastructure Act , that  would establish a framework to support a charging network.\nPennsylvania offers rebates of up to $1,500 for alternative-fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\nDepending on whether either legislation gets approved, environmentalists and even some business groups supporting the effort say electric vehicle charging will take off.\nThe federal government offers a tax credit for $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the size of the vehicle and its battery capacity.\nWawa is far from alone in offering charging, but it is a big chain moving into the space in a big way. Competitor Royal Farms, with far fewer stores in the region, also has some EV charging stations. PlugShare.com offers an interactive map to find chargers.\nMeanwhile, Vivianna Van Deerlin, the Tesla owner, thinks Wawa’s planned charging station in Maple Shade is smart, not only because it’s near her home, but because it’s close to a network of major roads, including the N.J. Turnpike, I-295, and the Betsy Ross Bridge.\n“Superchargers offer a great utility when you’re traveling away from home,” she said. “When you do stop, it takes about 10 or 15 minutes to charge. So it’s great to have a location that offers food, a bathroom, coffee, and even windshield cleaner fluid. Wawa is ideal.”\nPublished\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07'),

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its outlook for nickel and other metals.\nDemand for nickel from lithium-ion batteries is forecast to surge about 16 times to 1.8 million tons of contained metal by 2030, BNEF said in a July report. Batteries will account for more than half of demand for class one nickel by that date, shifting a market that’s currently focused on stainless steel.\nPerth-based Independence last year increased nickel output from its Nova mine in Western Australia by about a quarter and is spending as much as A$75 million ($51 million) on exploration in an effort to extend the asset’s life and find new deposits.\nNickel in London has jumped more than a third in 2019 and last month touched the highest in more than a year. Future battery demand will add further pressure on prices, according to Bradford, who is awaiting delivery this month of his own Tesla Model S.\n“The dramatic price rise we’ve seen will pale into insignificance compared to the future,’’ Bradford said in the Friday phone interview.\nJapan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., said in June the nickel market faces a deficit of 51,000 tons in 2019, raising an earlier forecast. Last month, First Quantum Minerals Ltd. confirmed it’ll reopen the Ravensthorpe mine in Western Australia – shuttered since 2017 – in the first quarter of 2020 amid the strength of interest from potential nickel and cobalt customers.\nWestern Areas Ltd. recently visited China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., a leading battery maker, and is winning interest from the EV sector for nickel supply contracts, the Perth-based producer said Monday in a presentation. Contracts with BHP Group and Tsingshan Holding Group Co. are scheduled to expire in January.\nMeetings with companies in the EV supply chain in China and South Korea in the past month, including battery suppliers and producers of key raw materials and chemicals, had also underscored the industry’s concerns about supply, Bradford said.\n“The big question everyone will be asking in a year’s time is where does the nickel come from to satisfy the demands for nickel in stainless steel, as well as the increasing demand for nickel into electric vehicle batteries?’’ he said.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-05'),

Bruce said it’s projected to open by December.”\nOver the last few years, Tesla has made several grand promises about expanding the Supercharger network, but it has been falling short.\nThe delay appeared to be at least partly related to the deployment of the new generation of the Supercharger technology, Supercharger V3, which itself saw several delays since last summer.\nTesla finally launched Supercharger V3 earlier this year, and they opened the first full-size station in Las Vegas last month.\nThe automaker is now operating 1,604 Supercharger Stations with 14,081 Superchargers around the world.\nElectrek’s Take\nEven though Tesla’s Supercharger rollout hasn’t been as fast as the automaker has previously promised, it’s still the best fast-charging network in the world.\n14,000 Superchargers at 1,600 stations are impressive numbers on their own, but there are also other impressive numbers, like most of those stations having a charging capacity of over 150 kW now, and the highest number of stalls per station than any other charging network.\nIt’s not surprising that gas stations and convenience stores want a piece of that.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

He wasnt given an installation timeline but was told his odds of receiving a Solar Roof would have been better if he lived in California.\nHe canceled his reservation after seven months.\n\"This is never going to happen,\" he recalled thinking at the time.\nBefore canceling, Hanson found Teslas customer-service department difficult to reach, and when he did get in touch, he couldnt tell whether the representatives he talked to were familiar with the details of his reservation or were giving him the same answer they gave everyone who asked when they would receive their Solar Roof: We dont know. Hanson got the feeling that the Solar Roof wasnt ready for production.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said in 2016 that the electric-car maker and its green-energy subsidiary SolarCity were preparing to bring solar roof tiles to market that would set his companies apart from rivals.\nThree years later, five current and former reservation-holders who signed up for the Solar Roof told Business Insider theyve been kept in the dark about when the product will be delivered.\nRead more: Tesla is reportedly making big changes to its energy unit as it tries to ramp up falling solar sales\nSaiMan Wong, who lives in Coral Springs, Florida, and made his Solar Roof deposit in August 2017, is close to canceling his reservation.\nHis roof is 42 years old and needs to be replaced soon. In the two years since he made his Solar Roof reservation, hes emailed Tesla twice to ask about his installation timeline. Both times, the company said it didnt know when his Solar Roof would be ready.\n\"I believe, especially if youre on a waiting list and put $1,000 in, they owe it to people to tell them when its rolling out,\" Wong said.\nWong recently hired a local contractor to replace his roof and install conventional solar panels, though hes been told by the contractor that hell have to wait about five months because of a shortage of the Spanish tiles that Coral Springs requires. Unless Tesla reaches out to him soon, hell have to cancel his Solar Roof reservation.\n\"I like the company, and I wish I could have had a Tesla roof,\" he said. \"I think I would have been the ideal candidate, but the conditions arent working out right now.\"\nTeslas Solar Roof.\nTesla\nThe Solar Roof installation process has been delayed\nTesla unveiled the Solar Roof , an integrated collection of tiles designed to hide solar cells inside, in October 2016, and customers have been able to reserve it since May 2017 . But the Solar Roofs rollout has reportedly been delayed by aesthetic issues and durability testing.\n\"This is actually quite a hard technology problem — to have an integrated solar panel, or solar cell, with a roof tile, and have it look good and last for 30 years,\" Musk said in June.\nA Tesla representative told Business Insider that the company regularly reveals products long before they become available and highlighted the Model 3 sedan, which was unveiled in March 2016 , 16 months before it was delivered to customers .\nRead more: Tesla is reportedly making big changes to its energy unit as it tries to ramp up falling solar sales\nTwo months before the Solar Roofs flashy introduction at Universal Studios just outside Los Angeles, Musk cited the product as a reason to support Teslas acquisition of the solar-panel manufacturer and installer SolarCity, a deal that has drawn criticism as Teslas solar-panel-installation business has plummeted.\n\"I think this is really a fundamental part of achieving differentiated product strategy,\" Musk said in August 2016 .\nHe added: \"Its not a thing on the roof. It is the roof, which is a quite difficult engineering challenge and not something that is available anywhere else.\"\nIn February 2017, Tesla said in an earnings letter that Solar Roof installations would begin later that year. And in August 2017, Tesla said the Solar Roof \"ultimately pays for itself by reducing or eliminating a homes electricity bill.\" (That month, Tesla also said it had completed the first Solar Roof installations on the homes of its employees.)\nBut Reuters reported in August 2018 that two months earlier, just 12 Solar Roofs were connected to the energy grid in California, the biggest market for Teslas vehicles.\nAnd in May, Reuters reported that a \"great majority\" of the solar cells produced by Panasonic at Teslas factory in Buffalo, New York, were being sold overseas instead of used in the Solar Roof, despite Teslas prediction a year earlier that Solar Roof production would \"accelerate significantly\" during the second half of that year.\nMusk unveiling Teslas Powerpack commercial battery.\nRingo H.W. Chiu / AP\nTesla should have anticipated its Solar Roof issues\nTesla should have foreseen the issues it has had rolling out the Solar Roof, said Sam Jaffe, a managing director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors. Solar roof tiles are more difficult to produce than traditional solar panels since the tiles have more complicated designs and wiring architectures.\n\"If it was easy to do solar tiles, it would have been done long ago,\" Jaffe said. Tesla, he said, \"shot for the moon, and they so far havent made it to the surface yet.\"\nMusk suggested in June that Tesla was making slow progress when he said the company was installing the Solar Roof in eight states, but he did not specify the number of roofs that had been delivered.\nRegarding the Solar Roofs cost efficiency, he struck a more cautious tone than Tesla did in 2017, saying it had \"a shot\" at being as expensive as or cheaper than a non-solar shingle roof plus the average cost of electricity for a single-family home.\nMusk sounded more confident in July, saying on Twitter that Tesla aimed to produce about 1,000 Solar Roofs per week by the end of 2019. But the tweet attracted controversy because there was no mention of that target in Teslas quarterly report, which had been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission just hours earlier.\nRead more: Tesla just announced a giant new battery\nDavid Balenciaga, who lives in Southern California, is one of the few people who have a Solar Roof installed on their home. For him, the roof has psychological benefits unrelated to its financial efficiency. It feels good to live almost entirely off of the electrical grid, he said.\n\"Im very happy,\" Balenciaga said. \"I mean, yes, it was a little expensive, but to be able to sit here and say that I have an entire four-bedroom home — its over 3,000 square feet — and I can run everything 100% off of the grid for life, thats pretty impressive.\"\nBalenciaga said that his electricity needs were greater than those of the average home, in part because he has to charge his Tesla Model X SUV, but that he rarely has to pull electricity from the grid. In addition to the Solar Roof, he has three Tesla Powerwall home batteries that can store the energy produced by the roof to use when the sun isnt out or his energy needs are greater than what the roof can supply.\nBetween the Solar Roof, the Powerwalls, and the Model X, Balenciaga embodies the vision Musk has for Tesla customers, able to live with little to no reliance on fossil fuels for their day-to-day energy needs.\n\"Its like Elon says: If youre buying a gasoline car in this day and age, its like buying a horse when cars became available,\" Balenciaga said. \"Why would you invest in that now?\"\nTeslas solar-panel deployments have declined since it acquired SolarCity.\nTaryn Colbert/Business Insider\nTeslas solar-panel business has declined\nBut questions remain about Teslas ability to fulfill Musks wide-ranging ambitions in the automotive and energy industries. Tesla was profitable during the second half of 2018, but the company has returned to posting losses during the first half of 2019 — despite record vehicle deliveries between April and June — leading some to question whether it can meet Musks promise of long-term profitability .\nAnd Teslas solar-panel business has plummeted since the 2016 SolarCity acquisition. At its peak, in the fourth quarter of 2016, Tesla deployed 201 megawatts of solar-panel capacity. In the second quarter of this year, solar deployments hit their lowest point, 29 megawatts.\nTesla fell to third place , behind SunRun and Vivint Solar, in North American residential solar-panel installations in the first quarter of 2019. In 2017, Tesla led that market by a wide margin.\n\"It doesnt appear that Tesla cares very much about their residential installation business,\" said Michelle Davis, a senior solar analyst for Wood Mackenzie.\n\"It would not be unfeasible if in two years they were not in the solar industry anymore,\" she added.\nA Tesla representative directed Business Insider to its second-quarter report from this year , in which it said, \"We are working on revamping the customer service experience for solar products through simplicity and accessibility by streamlining traditionally complex ordering, permitting, installation and back-end service processes, ultimately making our solar products even more compelling to consumers.\"\nIf rolled out in a meaningful way, the Solar Roof could give Tesla a high-margin product in a solar-panel market that produces low margins and aggressive cost-cutting, Jaffe said. While the Solar Roof would likely account for only a small percentage of Teslas energy business, it would allow the company to target the high end of the solar-panel market.\nContinuing to shift its emphasis to energy-storage products, like the Powerwall home battery and the Powerpack commercial battery, might be a wise choice if Tesla cant figure out a way to meet the demand for the Solar Roof. The energy-storage market has a higher potential for profitability than the solar-panel market, Jaffe said.\nTesla may have already realized this, as its storage installations have grown while its solar-panel installations have fallen. In 2018, storage deployments grew by 290%, to 1.04 gigawatt-hours from 358 megawatt-hours in 2017. And in the second quarter of this year, Tesla deployed 415 MWh of storage capacity, more than in any other quarter.\nTeslas energy-storage deployments have increased as its solar-panel business has declined.\nTaryn Colbert/Business Insider\nHave you worked for Tesla?

If you follow car punditry, the transportation business is daily being roiled, disturbed, upended, remade. Before you know it, where were going we wont need roads, and we certainly wont have any red barchettas to outrun gleaming alloy aircars.\nI dont actually think the auto industry is being disrupted in any meaningful way , and certainly not in the sense that the person who popularized the theory of disruptive innovation would recognize (that would be Harvards Clayton Christensen).\nIf you want to follow along at home, the upshot here is that Tesla, often named as the Prime Disruptor, is really just a car company whose cars run on electricity rather than gas and whose CEO runs a side business launching rockets.\nRead more: Teslas business is a mess — but its actually not that much different from every other car company\nHowever, as established automakers have begun to pursue much more aggressive electrification strategies, with an eye toward capturing what could be huge chunks of a future China market (perhaps 40 million in annual sales, with half or more powered by electrons), the prospect of a more interesting disruption has developed.\nClassic disruption versus opportunistic self-disruption\nPorsches Taycan EV.\nPorsche\nClassic disruption theory requires that incumbents be out-innovated by new entrants, who start out at the low, cheap end of the market and gradually advance their innovations to the point that they overwhelm the established players, who basically cant keep up.\nThe theory cant apply to EVs because the vehicles are too expensive; even a relatively inexpensive EV, such as the Chevy Bolt, is priced around $40,000. Teslas cars sell for between $50,000-100,000.\nBut Ive come to think that while disruptive-innovation-style disruption isnt taking place, a more productive version of \"self-disruption\" is. I might even go so far as to term it opportunistic.\nThe process goes like this. A Tesla comes along, with a wildly high-risk business model, and the big guys are happy to let Musk take his shot, gobbling up risk, validating a market, and spending other peoples money. The large car makers know that the business is extremely difficult, narrowly profitable in the best of times, and capital intensive. So they keep pace and make sure that a new player like Tesla doesnt achieve an unanswered breakthrough.\nBut then what?\nWell, once the market becomes promising, the big automakers start thinking in terms of what Ill call the CD paradigm.\nReplacing gas cars with electric ones\nDoesnt play vinyl.\nWikimedia Commons\nFrom roughly the mid-1980s until the arrival of online digital music platforms in the early 2000s, the music industry found an unexpected windfall in the compact disc. People bought CD players, the technology went into cars and became portable, offering better sound quality than cassettes, and folks had to switch over their music collections from vinyl records. The music business then basically resold everything they had already sold, in a different format (and often without even digitally remastering the previous vinyl releases).\nThe analogy isnt perfect, but the auto industry could be considering a similar outcome with gas-burning cars and electric vehicles. Over the next few decades, for various reasons ranging from government regulations to consumer attitudes toward global warming, car makers could see significant turnover in existing fleets. It doesnt matter what these vehicles are powered by — if people want to buy them, automakers will manufacture and sell them.\nSeveral trends in the industry suggest that were at the leading edge of this opportunistic self-disruption. General Motors brought the mass-market Bolt from concept to reality in about a year and has partnered with Honda to develop an autonomous EV; Porsche is rolling out its Taycan, which could be the first high-performance luxury EV of note; and Ford and VW have joined forces to use VWs EV platform in Europe, where both companies have regulatory concerns.\nWe could be heading for a the largest replacement wave of vehicles worldwide in the history of the automobile.\nSo where does this leave Tesla?\nThe leader that becomes the follower\nThe Tesla Model 3.\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nRead more: An all-electric Ford F-150 pickup truck prototype has towed more than a million pounds\nThe leader is now playing catch-up, although it currently dominates the existing EV market. Tesla has just one factory, with a new facility under construction in China and a third, the Nevada Gigafactory, doing double duty as a car-and-battery plant. Tesla could be steamrolled by global capacity, as it isnt terribly difficult for a car maker to convert a factory that makes gas vehicles to one that makes EVs.\nI know that sounds bad, but I dont think it means the end of Tesla. The company could handily survive as a producer of high-margin, high-priced vehicles.

It led to motels, parking lots, gas stations, highways and traffic jams. That one affordable, rugged machine literally altered the American landscape forever.\nNext to that, Tesla (TSLA) ’s impact seems modest.\nSure everyone agrees that, eventually, most cars will be electric . Tesla, just 16 years old, is already selling more electric cars than any other automaker. Even the long-established industry titans that are just now venturing into electric cars owe a debt to Musk. His company has made electric cars seem cool and desirable.\nBut that doesn’t mean the future of the industry lies solely in Tesla’s hands, said Hackett.\n“[F]itness, as we were saying, is a compendium of things that you have to get right. It’s not just the technology,” Hackett said. “In this case, we have to have an industrial model. Ford is really good at this.”\nHackett gestured west toward Dearborn, Michigan – Henry Ford’s birthplace and the location of Ford’s global headquarters, as well as its most famous factory, the River Rouge Complex.\n“[It] took 12 hours to build a vehicle before [Henry Ford] built it. It went down to 52 minutes,” Hackett said. “Today, we build an F-150 every 53 seconds.”\nWhen it opened in 1917, River Rouge was revolutionary. Henri Citroën, Louis Renault and Kiichiro Toyoda, founder of the Toyota Motor Company, all visited Dearborn to see how Ford did it, taking lessons back to their home countries.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nFord CEO: Autonomous vehicles will solve problems\n03:06 - Source:\n                CNN Business\nTesla, on the other hand, has famously struggled to increase production at its Fremont, California, factory and , even as output has risen , quality issues remain. Despite being impressed by their practicality and performance, Consumer Reports doesn’t recommend any Tesla products because of poor reliability.\nOf course, having been a disruptive force over a century ago doesn’t mean much if the industry goes on changing without you. Sears changed American retailing in the 20th century , but that hasn’t helped it compete against Amazon in the 21st .  Hackett’s job is to help Ford manage the raft of changes heading the auto industry’s way today.\nFord’s profits still rely heavily on those gasoline- and diesel-powered cars and trucks being turned out one-a-minute. But Hackett knows the future will be different – and he insists that Ford will not be caught unawares.\nAs it works to ready itself for the future, Ford has been cutting jobs , making investments and forming partnerships. The automaker recently invested $500 million in Rivian, a Michigan-based company working on electric pickup trucks and SUVs, and the two companies are working together on a plug-in vehicle for Ford.\nSimilarly, Ford’s new partnership with Volkswagen will also yield two new electric models for the European market. As part of the deal, Volkswagen agreed to join Ford in investing in Pittsburgh-based Argo AI, an autonomous vehicle platform company. Earlier this year, Ford invested $1 billion in Argo, a bold move that proved the company was serious about self-driving technology.\nLyft and Uber have said their ride sharing services will someday spell the end of car ownership, but Hackett disagrees.\n“Absolutely we will be selling cars, and trucks, and other kinds of products, because the future disruption is not coming from rides… We already have rides today. So, the disruption is different that’s coming,” he told Harlow.\nTo Hackett, that disruption will come from self-driving technology and the artificial intelligence used to make cars smarter.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07');

I’ve had it for three years. I’ve never done anything. There’s no fluids to change. There’s nothing.”\nElectric cars, like Tesla’s, virtually have no regular maintenance and while some cars had reliability issues, there are far fewer moving parts in an electric car’s powertrain than in a gas-powered car, which results in a higher potential for long-term reliability.\nLeno believes that “electric cars are the future”. He added:\n“Steam ran everything from 1800 to about 1911. Then internal combustion took over from 1911 to right about now. And I predict that a child born today probably has as much chance of driving in a gas car as people today have been driving a car with a stick shift,”\nThe show host credits Tesla for pushing the technology to a higher level over the internal combustion engine.\nHe continued:\n“For new technology to succeed, it can’t be equal. It’s got to be better and [Tesla] sort of solved the battery problem. It can go 350 to 400 miles at a charge. … There’s no maintenance. They’re faster than the gas car. So there’s almost no reason to have a gas car unless you’re doing long-haul duty.”\nLeno owns a Model S and he has taken an interest in other Tesla vehicles in the past. He got a rare look at Tesla’s next-gen Roadster prototype last year.\nHere’s the full interview with Jay Leno:\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Now one hacker has found a way to put a sample of that power—for safety, he says, and for surveillance—into the hands of anyone with a Tesla and a few hundred dollars to spare.\nAt the Defcon hacker conference today, security researcher Truman Kain debuted what he calls the Surveillance Detection Scout. The DIY computer fits into the middle console of a Tesla Model S or Model 3, plugs into its dashboard USB port, and turns the cars built-in cameras—the same dash and rearview cameras providing a 360-degree view used for Teslas Autopilot and Sentry features—into a system that spots, tracks, and stores license plates and faces over time. The tool uses open source image recognition software to automatically put an alert on the Teslas display and the users phone if it repeatedly sees the same license plate. When the car is parked, it can track nearby faces to see which ones repeatedly appear. Kain says the intent is to offer a warning that someone might be preparing to steal the car, tamper with it, or break into the drivers nearby home.\nOr click here to watch the video .\nDespite the obvious privacy concerns, Kain pitches his invention primarily as a helpful tool for Tesla owners who rate above average on the paranoia spectrum. \"It turns your Tesla into an AI-powered surveillance station,\" Kain says. \"Its meant to be another set of eyes, to help out and tell you its seen a license plate following you over multiple days, or even multiple turns of a single trip.\"\nKain, a consultant for the security firm Tevora, also isnt oblivious to his creations creep factor. He says the Surveillance Detection Scout demonstrates the kind of surveillance the data that self-driving cars already collect could enable. If a large group of Surveillance Detection Scout users were to combine their license plate recognition data—a feature that Kain has purposefully left out of the software—the system could create a crowdsourced version of the same powerful surveillance provided by commercial automatic license plate reader systems, whose use by police has been banned in some states. \"I’d be able to see everyone across the US, thousands of cars on this Surveillance Scout network,\" Kain says. \"So I think there’s a real ethical issue there.\"\nA Panopticon in Your Console\nSurveillance Detection Scout stores and analyzes its video on an Nvidia minicomputer that fits into a Tesla Model S’s console.\nRoger Kisby\nThe Surveillance Detection Scout prototype, whose software Kain has made available on Github, works by capturing and analyzing the video from a Teslas three cameras—two on its sideview mirrors and one forward-facing—on a $700 Nvidia Jetson Xavier mini-computer. It uses an open source neural network framework called Darknet as its machine learning engine, along with ALPR Unconstrained for recognizing license plates and Facenet for tracking faces. Both of those programs are available for free on Github. The system also uses Googles Open Images Dataset as training data.\nMost Popular\nGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office Chairs\nJulian Chokkattu\n\"I’m not doing any cutting-edge AI,\" Kain says. \"I’m just applying what’s already freely available, off the shelf.\" The software even identifies the make and model of cars it sees based on license plate lookups on the service FindByPlate.com. (Kain says its far harder to link license plates to actual names, and he doesnt intend to include that data in his tool.)\nAn example of a push notification sent to a phone from Surveillance Detection Scout.\nCourtesy Truman Kain\nKain says he came up with the idea for his follower detection mechanism last year after he attended a talk on countersurveillance at last years Defcon. Hed been thinking since he first bought his Tesla Model 3 about the gigabytes of video it collected and deleted, overwriting its video logs every hour. \"I had a little bit of FOMO, thinking about how all this video is gone if I dont do something with it,\" Kain says.\nA screenshot of Surveillance Detection Scout’s interface, showing recently detected license plates.\nCourtesy Truman Kain\nAfter learning about a tool available on Github called Tesla USB that allows Tesla owners to store their video to an external drive indefinitely, Kain came up with the idea of combining that storage capability with image recognition to give his car features similar to the Nest camera in his home, which includes so-called \"familiar face detection.\" Beyond tracking license plates, the face detection element of his tool also functions as what he describes as an upgrade to Teslas existing Sentry security system, which starts recording when someone touches your car and sets off an alarm if they attempt to break into it.\nBy stitching together a patchwork of public code, Kains 4-inch-cubed box can recognize license plate numbers and faces from the cars video stream and alert the cars owner if it spots repeated plates or faces in that data. It uses the software integration tool If This Then That to send alerts. By default, the system will notify the driver if it sees the same car following for every minute over a five-minute span, though Kain says the settings can be adjusted to the drivers preference. The notifications have about a one-minute delay, Kain says, because of the time a Teslas cameras take to record a video file. And for now, users have to set up their own web server for it to work, though Kain says he may offer simpler web-based logins on his own server in the future.\nA Surveillance Camera on Wheels\nKain proposes some scenarios where his system could do some good: confidential sources meeting with a journalist, or anyone else who has reason to believe theyre being followed or targeted by snoops. \"If it helps keeps someone safe, that’s great,\" Kain says. \"If it lets me know that someone’s sneaking around my car, that’s also great.\"\nAndy Greenberg is a WIRED security writer and author of the forthcoming book, Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlins Most Dangerous Hackers .\nThe Surveillance Detection Scout, however, faces not just ethical issues but also legal ones, says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist with the Center for Democracy and Technology. State laws against automatic license place readers, even for private use, would likely make it illegal in Arkansas, Georgia, Maine, and New Hampshire. Its facial recognition features make it illegal in Illinois.\nLaws aside, Hall argues that Kains invention could have unintended consequences and serious privacy implications. Confrontations could result from false positives, he says, if a driver mistakenly believes theyre being followed by someone who happens to have the same commute. \"I’m worried about the subjective judgment a human would make from this technological system,\" says Hall. \"That could result in people pulling guns on each other when theres really nothing to worry about.\"\nHall also worries more broadly worry about the widespread form of AI-enabled surveillance that the system represents, particularly if its users tweaked Kains code to share their data with each other. \"Youre going to have very rich records of people’s movements,\" Hall says. \"It’s essentially a surveillance camera on wheels, not providing anyone notice of that fact, mapping pieces of peoples paths through the cities they live in.\"\nKain says he’s not oblivious to his surveillance invention’s creep factor: “I think there’s a real ethical issue there.”\nRoger Kisby\nEven more troubling, Hall says, would be the potential for law enforcement to gain access to the data, either through some sort of incentive to drivers—just as local police in some cities have subsidized Amazons Ring home surveillance cameras as a way to encourage people to share tips —or by compelling users to share it with subpoenas.\nKain says hes aware of those concerns, and built his system in part to demonstrate the possibilities of self-driving cars video surveillance before a shady commercial startup could do it first—one that might aggregate the data between users rather than keep it separated. A new era of ubiquitous self-driving car video data collection is coming, he says, and that much of it may end up on centralized repositories.\nBut he also admits that someone could easily tweak his code to enable data sharing between users, taking a big step toward the very future he warns about. \"It would be trivial for someone to build that in if they have any development experience,\" Kain says. \"Is it a slippery slope? Potentially.\"\nAll images Roger Kisby/Redux Pictures.\nThis story has been updated to clarify the nature of law enforcement Ring subsidies.\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-09'),

The primary work is located in our well-equipped lab, building, debugging and testing our various electronics, battery, and thermal systems and components.”\nTesla is also looking for “Engineering Technicians for Reliability & Test in Fremont”.\nThe automaker describes the position:\n“This position will work as a member of Tesla’s Engineering Test Team to support vehicle level testing for Reliability and Durability tests performed in-house and at external test labs. The primary objective of this role is to maintain and assure safe and reliable performance of test vehicles and conduct vehicle level tests in accordance with Tesla test procedures. The successful candidate for this position must have a broad background in automotive maintenance and testing.”\nCEO Elon Musk recently set some ambitious goals when it comes to the reliability of Tesla’s vehicles.\nHe also added that Tesla is working on a new battery that lasts 1 million miles and it could come out as soon as next year.\nElectrek’s Take\nIt’s funny because Elon recently said that “the best service is no service” and Tesla is focusing on improving reliability so that owners will almost never have to bring their car to service and Tesla is now literally turning a service training facility into a reliability lab.\nOf course, I am sure that Tesla is planning to do service training somewhere else and the company actually moved a lot of its training online, but it’s still an interesting turn of event.\nElon appears to be serious about his ambitious reliability goals for Tesla.\nWith the advent of self-driving cars, vehicles are going to see a lot more hours of operation in a much shorter period of time. It will not be rare to see cars doing over 80,000 miles per year.\nAutomakers who make their self-driving cars more reliable are going to get a lot more value out of them and achieve lower cost of per mile.\nWhen you don’t have a driver and you are running on electricity, maintenance and the amortization of the vehicle are starting to play a bigger role in the cost per mile of a self-driving vehicle.\nTesla is really thinking ahead here in order to be competitive in a future where a lot of people, if not most people, are going to be traveling around in a shared fleet of all-electric self-driving vehicles for a set cost per mile. It should greatly reduce the cost of transport and every cent is going to count in order to be competitive.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Billed as the first and only battery-powered vehicle that uses lithium ion batteries, which charge faster than regular batteries, the car is a killer mode of transportation for cruising around the cul-de-sac. Or parents who want their kids to smugly talk about the efficiency of their vehicle.\nThe Radio Flyer Tesla Model S lets drivers toggle between six or three miles per hours, depending on their need for speed — or the laws of your neighborhood. Specs aside, the Tesla just looks great. It has the same telltale Model S body, along with black rims and purring motor. Because of its ion batteries, the Tesla electric car apparently runs three longer and charges faster than competitive models. It has a six mile range and can be driven in forward or reverse mode. And like its adult counterpart, it charges through the tail light port; otherwise, you can remove the battery to charge it separately.\nRadio Flyer Tesla Model S Kids Electric Car\nYour kid can cruise around in this dope electric Tesla Model S car.\nBuy Now $599.99\nBecause it can’t be a Tesla without high-tech flourishes, the car also has LED headlights, a working horn, and a music player. So your kid can blast DJ Marshmellow or Imagine Dragons while going for a leisurely Sunday drive. And when kiddo is done, he or she can store his loafers and driving gloves in the trunk. Yes, trunk.\nBecause this is no ordinary electric kids’ car, you can choose the paint color, performance, accessories, and personalization. After all, it’s one of the many things (along with founder Elon Musk’s, ahem, idiosyncrasies) that the brand is famous for.\nA basic Model S would set adults back $70,115. Fortunately, the child version is more affordable, at $600, a nice price drop from an earlier model that, three years ago, retailed for as much as its adult brethren.\nEvery product on Fatherly is independently selected by our editors, writers, and experts.

Of course, there are a lot of dash cams to pick from with various levels of quality and features. Luckily, one of the better dash cams is on sale right now, the Nextbase 4k Dash Cam, and while it usually goes for $400, you can grab it from Best Buy for just $350. While that may not seem like much, $350 for a 4k-capable dash cam is impressive.\nWhy you should buy the Nextbase 622GW 4K Dash Cam The Nexbase 622GW is packed with some impressive features, such as the 4k resolution, which films at 30fps, although it can film at 60fps at 2k and, interestingly, 120fps at 1080p, although we doubt youll very much run the last mode regularly. More importantly, it comes with some advanced image stabilization to help deal with the vibrations and bumps from your car, plus it comes with some next-level night vision and image polarization to help with sunny conditions that might otherwise cause glare. Even better, it has internal processing capable of helping with misty conditions, making this a great camera for all-weather driving, which is impressive for such a small package.\nCars\n900 miles on a charge? How Toyota’s solid-state battery tech could revolutionize EVs\nThe biggest question first-time buyers have when buying an EV relates to range. \"How far can I go in this thing?\"\nIt makes sense. While making it 300 miles or so isnt bad for a modern EV, it does mean that you have to stop at a charging station more regularly than you have to fill a tank on a gas-powered car, and charging can be a little time-consuming. So whats the fix? Either better range or faster charging -- and Toyota says that it has cracked the code for the former.\nCars\nDeal: Save $120 on this 25ft, 32-Amp home electric vehicle charger\nI dont want to go to work. I dont want to go to the grocery store. I dont want to go to the gas station. Increasingly, Im able to skip out on any of these annoyances. With electric vehicles, for instance, you can just plug in your car at home. Well, if you have a home vehicle charger, you can. And with the cutely named Juicebox (no, this isnt a grocery home delivery deal) you can get all of your charging done at home, on the cheap. Now, through the end of the day, the Juicebox 32-Amp Vehicle Charger is only $459. Its usually $579, so that means youre getting a $120 savings. Again, this is only available until 1 AM EST, so you have a little bit of time to grab one, but if you know you need it, do yourself a favor and tap the button below now.\nWhy you should buy the Juicebox 32-Amp Vehicle Charger The Juicebox 32-Amp Vehicle Charger is a level 2 smart EV charging station. Its designed to work with all electric vehicles on the market today (including Tesla, so you dont have to run out to a Tesla Supercharger) via an adapter. Whats nice about the Juicebox 32-Amp Vehicle Charger is that — unlike a traditional charging station — its built to save you money. For example, since it is a smart device, it can be scheduled to charge only when electric grid rates are at their lowest. An app connects to the charger directly, letting you go about your day while your car is charging. Youll get updates about your cars progress on the go. JuiceNet, which is the name of the app, can also remind you to charge your car if you ever get lazy about it, too!\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-04'),

To prevent that, we poll the car this way: We poll the car every 30 seconds while driving or every 2 minutes while charging. After that, we just keep polling for about 30 minutes (to catch the following drive if you stopped for a drink, for example).  After that period, Teslastics stops polling the car for about 12 minutes to let the car go to sleep. It repeats that again and again until the car goes to sleep or it starts driving/charging again. Once sleeping, Teslastics will never wake up the car. It will only be checking twice a minute if it is still sleeping or not.”\nThat convinced me to try a third-party Tesla app for the first time.\nI have been using it for my Model 3 over the last few weeks and I’ve found it very useful. It’s actually so feature-rich that I feel like I have barely scratched the surface so far.\nThere are many different reasons to use Teslastics.\nFor example, you can simply track all your travels with your Tesla with a daily summary. Here’s an example from my drives yesterday:\nFrom there, you can dive into a lot more data about specific trips.\nHere’s an example from a trip to Quebec City I did last week:\nYou can clearly see my efficiency being down and my actual range off the ideal range at the begining of the trip because I was driving fast.\nAt the end, the efficiency went way up when we slowed down and let the inside temperature go up.\nTeslastics also keeps track of your most efficient drives as well as your charging efficiency.\nHere’s a Supercharger session example from last weekend:\nThose are the main features of the app, but there are aslo some other useful features like tracking battery health and software updates:\nOne of my favorite features, although it’s not particularly useful but fun, is a heatmap of all your travels with your Tesla vehicle:\nI’ve been using a free trial for the last few weeks, but I find myself using it often enough that I think it might be worth the $4 per month, which is not exactly cheap.\nYou can use the Electrek referral code to sign up to Teslastics with a month-long free trial and see for yourself if it’s worth it.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

[+] of Tesla unveiled suit of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities at Tesla Design Studio April 30, 2015 in Hawthorne, California. Musk unveiled the home battery named Powerwall with a selling price of $3500 for 10kWh and $3000 for 7kWh and very large utility pack called Powerpack. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\nGetty\nFrom large facilities to electric vehicles powered by Tesla batteries, the one thing they have in common are the origins of a key component called cobalt. This metal which resides primarily in Africa is used by nearly every major tech company and automakers alike, with Tesla pushing the boundaries due to its new Megapack battery product for utility-scale projects . Is Tesla’s latest battery charge going to upend the future stability of sustainable cobalt supply in Africa?\nThe Breakdown You Need to Know\nThis new Megapack is basically a giant battery that will provide energy for power grids.Tesla tested the technology for Megapacks in a facility in Australia, which according to the company saved more than $40 million in its first year of operation. While that may seem all good, the main problem is that it’s a huge Lithium-ion battery which is mainly comprised of lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite as active cathode materials.\nDemocratic Republic of Congo accounted for around 64% of global mined cobalt production last year, according to the United States Geological Survey. Tesla’s latest battery will force the company to gain a larger portion of the cobalt supply. Also, Darton Commodities predicts cobalt use in batteries is going to jump from 50,000 tons in 2016 to more than 320,000 tons by the year 2030.\nThe Congolese government has increased its tax on Cobalt exports by 50% and is considering labeling the metal a strategic resource. This would increase the royalty for Cobalt from 2% to 10%, making it more expensive for companies like Tesla to use in its products.\nCobalt Conundrum:Cobalt remains the bedrock of electric vehicle batteries and massive battery packs, albeit with varying composition ratios. Tesla’s energy storage division already offers two other products including the Powerwall, which is a large battery to power your home and the Powerpack battery system for commercial use. If we look at the original Powerwall for example, it has a cathode makeup of cobalt, nickel and manganese in equal portions, the new Powerwall 2 has slightly less cobalt. Tesla’s Model S electric vehicle battery had a cathode compilation of 80% nickel, 15% cobalt and 5% aluminium, according to Small Caps.\nWhen referring to the use of the highly sought after metal for Tesla’s Model 3 electric vehicle battery, Elon Musk told CultureBanx last summer that, \"we use less than 3% cobalt in our batteries & will use none in next [generation].\"\nMining Value\nThere’s a reason why cobalt is so valuable, and its because the metal allows the cathodes to focus immense power in a confined space. Simply put, without the elements energy density, batteries without cobalt tend to perform worse and is why companies like Tesla can’t function without it.\nBig tech companies are the biggest users of the metal, with Apple’s iPhone battery’s cathode at 100%. Other tech companies like Samsung and Panasonic are high end-users of the metal as well. Nonetheless, smartphones only use about eight grams of refined cobalt whereas a battery for an electric car requires over 1,000 times more. Its important to note that child labor issues have been reported in the mining of cobalt and it’s hard to track the metals origination once it has reached the end of the supply chain.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-06'),

The latest location is under construction in Maple Shade, Pa., and is set to open in December.\nWawa, based in Wawa, Pa., began adding EV charging stations to its sites in 2017 . Tesla Supercharger locations typically feature eight charging stations, which add about 150 miles of range per 15 minutes of charging. Tesla’s newest EV models have a driving range of up to 370 miles, which would take a driver just beyond the distance from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.\nMost of Wawa’s Tesla Supercharger locations are in New Jersey, at stores in Florence, Woodbridge, Paulsboro, Kearny, Parsippany and Barnegat. Other locations are in Lewes, Claymont and Dover, Delaware; Chester and Fredericksburg, Va; and Pinellas Park, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville and West Palm Beach, Fla. Wawa does not have any Tesla Supercharger sites in Pennsylvania, although Bruce told The Inquirer “that will change.” It does have an EV charging station from Electrify America, the charging network subsidiary of Volkswagen, in the state.\nVivianna Van Deerlin, a Tesla owner, told The Inquirer that the Supercharger site planned for Wawas new Maple Shade location is convenient because it is close to her home and major roads such as the New Jersey Turnpike, I-295 and the Betsy Ross Bridge.\n“Superchargers offer a great utility when you’re traveling away from home,” she said. “When you do stop, it takes about 10 or 15 minutes to charge. So it’s great to have a location that offers food, a bathroom, coffee and even windshield cleaner fluid. Wawa is ideal.”\nOther c-store retailers that host Tesla Supercharger locations on their lots include Sheetz, which has more than 20 sites; Royal Farms ; QuickChek ; and Love’s Travel Stops . QuickChek Corp., Whitehouse Station, N.J., just added a Supercharger station to its Robbinsville, N.J., location, according to the town’s Facebook page . The Robbinsville QuickChek opened in January 2019 and features a nearly 5,500-square-foot c-store with 50% of its space dedicated to fresh food and beverages, including a made-to-order foodservice program. QuickChek debuted its first Tesla Supercharger site in 2016 at a store in Ulster, N.Y.\nMembers help make our journalism possible.

Car hoods are up and workers tinker around as they try to fix whatever is hampering a car’s performance. Large, multi-drawer tool chests sit alongside more complicated diagnostic equipment. At one car, a couple of service team members work on putting a window back in place.\nWhile the service bay may look familiar, this isn’t your father’s old garage.\nA closer look around reveals that there are no oil stains on the service station floor, probably because these cars don’t need to have their oil changed and oil filters replaced. Instead of a line of cars and trucks rumbling away during state-required smog checks, there is not a whiff of fuel exhaust in the air.\nThis service center has one more difference from your corner garage. It isn’t in an actual garage, but in the automotive technology building at San Jose’s Evergreen Valley College (EVC). And the people working on the cars aren’t officially mechanics.\nThey are EVC students learning the ins and outs of repairing Tesla Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles as part of the Tesla START program, an educational and training partnership between the electric carmaker and EVC that has been set up to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to step directly into jobs at Tesla service centers after they finish their training.\nEVC is one of six community and junior colleges around the country — and the only one in the Bay Area — where Tesla operates its START program. Tesla set up its first such partnership at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, North Carolina, in March 2018, and has since expanded the program to schools in Seattle, Miami, Seiden, New York, and at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, near Los Angeles. To date, almost 200 students have graduated from START programs. (Tesla has said START is not an acronym for anything.)\nEVC launched its START training program earlier this year, and the first cohort of 12 students completed the 12-week course in April. The nine students currently enrolled in the school’s summer START session are set to graduate Aug. 23, with the next cohort expected to included 12 to 15 students when the course begins again Sept. 9.\nManiphone Dickerson, dean of workforce development at EVC, said it was a set of corresponding circumstances that helped the school land Tesla’s START program. Among the factors in EVC’s favor were that it already had a strong automotive training department, and had integrated courses on services for electric-hybrid cars into its curriculum for several years.\n“The relationship with Tesla is very innovative. It’s very next generation,” Dickerson said. “The way it has benefited our students is that it is in line with the future workforce. We are really focused on teaching students for tomorrow’s jobs, and Tesla is the catalyst.”\nTesla doesn’t provide figures about how much it has invested in the START program. As Tesla does with all it START program partners, the company provided EVC with the curriculum, instructors, cars and equipment, and built out the training facility. All EVC had to do was provide shop space on campus, which was already available.\n“It’s a program that benefits us, and Tesla,” Dickerson said. “We get to add a new level of education, and Tesla gets new employees who are already educated and don’t need to train on the job.”\nWhile all of EVC’s current START program members are enrolled in the school’s auto tech work experience course, being enrolled in a community college is not a requirement for the START program as the application process is open to anyone who meets Tesla’s enrollment guidelines .\nAnd when Tesla began scoping out possible locations for its first START program in the Bay Area, the fact that EVC is just a few miles down the highway from Tesla’s Fremont factory was clearly a draw.\n“(START) provides a unique opportunity for students to get specialized technician training in the emerging electric vehicle industry,” said Martti Thomas, Tesla’s manager for North American service training programs. “Partnering with Evergreen Valley College allows us to leverage an established automotive training program right in our backyard.”\nDuring their training, students are also classified as Tesla interns, are paid for their time, and in addition to learning how to service Teslas with daily classroom studies and lab work, they spend at least one day a week “shadowing” Tesla technicians at local Tesla service centers to see how the cars are serviced.\nAccording to Tesla, nearly all of the students who have completed the START program have been placed in jobs at one of the company’s service centers. As long as a student graduates from the program, Tesla will work to immediately match that student with a service center opening.\nEVC students in the current cohort said that the opportunity to be around Teslas in a real-world service environment is one of the reasons why the START stands out from other automotive service training programs.\n“I’ve never experienced that with other trade schools and manufacturers,” said Brandon Christie, of San Jose, an EVC student and START program member who said he is also a five-year veteran of the automotive industry. “We’ve just gone to training, and then you’re hoping you can apply it when you’re working on actual customers’ vehicles after you’ve gotten hired. With this, you do it while you’re training, so right as you’re learning it, you’re doing it, and it really gets pounded into your head.”\nFor Natalie Flores, the START program has led her from the classroom, to the Tesla service center, and back to the classroom, where she is an instructor for the current EVC cohort. Flores said she was in the automotive technician training program at Rio Hondo when the START program began there. Flores got accepted into START, graduated in 2018, worked at a Tesla service center for six months, and then was hired as an instructor at the EVC program in October.\n“I juggle being a manager, and an instructor,” Flores said. “Typically, we make sure to have a lecture depending on what we’re covering for the week. Then we go into our workbooks and those are associated with labs within whatever we are covering. And once we learn about it, we get to practice on it hands-on in the vehicles.”\nFlores said that START students also learn that many of the problems Teslas encounter don’t even require those cars to be brought into a service center. Tesla provides mobile units that technicians take to customers’ homes or workplaces to work on a car. In other cases, Flores says that Tesla’s software allows service team members to diagnose and fix problems remotely.\n“Depending on the customer’s issue, I’d say as much as 90% of repairs could be done over the air,” Flores said. “We utilize our laptops more than anything.”\nFlores said that having automotive industry experience is helpful when applying to the START program, but not a necessity. EVC student Rakee Cromwell said he had no background working on cars when he was studying physics and mathematics at Susquehanna University, in Pennsylvania, when about a year ago, he applied online for the START program.\nRelated Articles\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-02'),

For grid power installations, that means companies can install fewer than one-tenth the units that they needed for the same amount of storage in Powerpacks.\nWith greater energy density, Tesla says a storage bank using Megapacks can take up 40 percent less space than one built with Powerpacks.\nArtists rendering of Tesla Megapack grid storage installation\nTesla built what it says is the largest commercial battery-storage operation in the world with a 129 megawatt-hour installation in Hornsdale, South Australia, using more than 600 Powerpacks. The same installation using Megapacks would require just 43 Megapacks.\nWith fewer units, the systems can be assembled in one-tenth the time, Tesla says.\nThe Megapacks can also enable much larger-scale projects, including up to 1 gigawatt-hour or larger, which would be enough to power every home in San Francisco for six hours, Tesla says.\nSuch stationary batteries are designed as to enable utilities to integrate more renewable energy such as wind and solar farms onto the grid. With battery storage ( or pumped hydro ), the batteries can store solar power from sunny days to use at night or on rainy days, and energy generated by windmills, to be used during calm days.\nThat can make the power grid more reliable and give operators more flexibility.\nTesla Powerpacks\nIncreasing the capacity of renewable wind and solar power on the grid helps make the cars that run on electricity cleaner and comparatively more efficient .\nTesla says it is planning the first utility-scale battery storage installation using Megapacks in a PG&E project in Moss Landing, California , to power Silicon Valley, which has had problems with blackouts. The project, proposed last year, aims to build a 567 megawatt storage facility, using several contractors including Tesla. Teslas installation will account for 182.5 megawatt-hours of the project, which is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2020.\n\"Energy storage plays an increasingly important role in Californias clean energy future,\" said Roy Kuga, vice president, Grid Integration and Innovation at PG&E in a statement announcing the project. \"Recent decreases in battery prices are enabling energy storage to become a competitive alternative to traditional solutions. As a result, we believe that battery energy storage will be even more significant in enhancing overall grid reliability, integrating renewables, and helping customers save energy and money.\"\nIn Teslas second-quarter financial report earlier this month, the company said that its commercial energy storage business grew by 81 percent, and that it has battery storage systems, including home Powerwalls, installed in 50,000 locations.\nTags:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-02'),

Chess Grandmaster Fabiano Caruana, who currently holds the #1 Chess rating in the United States, recently challenged a Model 3 as his opponent in Tesla’s version of the game.\nDuring his in-car Tesla Chess challenge, Caruana gave a play-by-play explanation and specifically expressed his approval of the computer’s moves throughout. “It’s not making any mistakes…[It’s] playing quite impressively,” he commented in the beginning of the game. At one point, Caruana compared the software’s strategy to a live player. “Now, if it were a human, I’d hope it would be slightly scared. But I don’t think a Tesla gets scared.” The fairly quick Chess match ended in a victory for Caruana, but it seemed to be a satisfying win overall. “I’ve won the game, but it wasn’t an easy one. Not at all…it was a challenging game,” he concluded.\nChess joined the Tesla Arcade lineup just within the last week, and its arrival was full of human-vs-computer competitive spirit . “When your car can do zero-to-sixty faster than you can make your next move, we call that a checkmate,” the company’s official Twitter account teased in its announcement of the game’s release. The tweet was also accompanied by a western-themed video.\nIt’s not every day that I get to play against a chess-playing car!

The California-based car maker has even more games coming to the Tesla Arcade in the near future as part of the Version 10 (V10) firmware release. “V10 will include several games & infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light & stop sign recognition & Smart Summon,” CEO Elon Musk recently announced via Twitter.\nDuring an appearance at the 2019 E3 Coliseum event, Musk and legendary video game designer Todd Howard noted that Cuphead, widely regarded as one of the finest run-and-gun indie games, and Fallout Shelter, a mobile title based on the blockbuster gaming franchise, were coming soon to the Tesla Arcade . While their release has not been specifically mentioned as part of V10, the timing does seem to match up and a firmware release with major game inclusions would make sense. A new racing game played with the steering wheel called Beach Buggy 2: Tesla Edition was added also last month to replace Pole Position, and support for a second controller was released alongside Chess.\nWatch Fabiano Caruana’s full Chess match against a Tesla Model 3 below:\nTesla Arcade duels US Chess Grandmaster in Model 3 vs. human matchup\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-03'),

(Photo: RyanMNg/Reddit )\nPosted on\nAugust 9, 2019\nFor Tesla owner James Salantiri, his Model 3 and the valet-only Supercharger station at the William Vale Parking Garage in Brooklyn, NY are intertwined. With his apartment just 10 minutes away by foot from the parking garage, Salantiri is a regular in the business. He would drive over to William Vale, hand his vehicle over to the valets, and drive away the next day, charged and ready for the road.\nIt was a system that has worked since he took delivery of his black Long Range Model 3 RWD on March 2018. Salantiri had waited long for his Model 3, having been one of the reservation holders who waited in line to put a deposit on the vehicle during the day of its unveiling. The parking garage has served him well, even when Tesla started rolling out strict Supercharger idle fees.\nTesla initially introduced a $0.40 per minute idle fee for its Supercharger Network on December 2016 to discourage owners from keeping their vehicles connected to the high-powered charging stations even when their electric cars are fully charged. Tesla raised its idle fees on September 2018, adjusting the fees to $.50 per minute. When a charging location is fully occupied, the company’s idle fees go as high as $1.00 per minute.\nThis system is particularly tricky for Tesla owners like James Salantiri, who regularly use valet-only Urban Superchargers to charge their vehicles. In a message to Teslarati, the Model 3 owner noted that William Vale’s valets would usually charge Teslas and unplug them as needed when the parking garage gets full as part of their service. At times when the parking garage is relatively empty, the valets would at times go the extra mile by plugging a vehicle overnight.\nWhen the electric car maker rolled out its updated Supercharger idle fees, Salantiri was informed by a Tesla representative that since the garage is valet-only, and since owners have no control when their vehicles are plugged in or taken off the Urban Superchargers at the location , any idle fees incurred at the parking garage would be waived. This setup worked well. Even when the vehicle is left plugged in overnight and large idle fees are incurred by his Model 3, Salantiri would see the charges either waived or refunded.\n(Credit: James Salantiri)\n(Credit: James Salantiri)\nPrevious idle fees at the Urban Supercharger were previously waived or refunded automatically. (Credit: James Salantiri)\nThings changed recently. Upon looking at his recent bank statement, the Model 3 owner noticed two Tesla Supercharger charges to his account amounting to $1,147.16, comprised of a $171.04 charge on August 1 and a $976.12 charge on July 23. This prompted Salantiri to contact the electric car maker, where a representative reportedly informed him that a refund wasn’t possible due to the Supercharger not being on Tesla property. In the following call that was escalated to a supervisor, Salantiri was told that the recent fees could not be waived or refunded since the company’s waive/refund policy for Supercharger idle fees only covers an initial charge. Attempts to contact the parking garage’s new management about the issue were also unsuccessful.\nA look into Tesla forums such as the Tesla Motors Club shows that Salantiri’s issue was not an isolated incident. Another Tesla owner, who goes by the username choatie88 , noted that he was also charged a notable idle fee at the same location since his vehicle was left to charge overnight. In a message, the Tesla owner noted that he eventually got a one-off refund once he explained the parking garage’s valet-only nature to Tesla. Unfortunately for Salantiri, his one-off refund/waive credit appears to have been used up over his regular trips to the location.\n(Credit: James Salantiri)\n(Credit: James Salantiri)\nThe Model 3 owner’s recent Urban Supercharger idle fees from the valet-only parking garage. (Credit: James Salantiri)\nTesla noted in its Supercharger idle fee announcement last September that there is no upper limit on the amount of fees that a vehicle could accrue. This is absolutely fair in public charging stations where owners have full control when they could plug in and remove their vehicles from a Supercharger, but this system hits somewhat of a gray area when it comes to valet-only parking locations. It would be difficult for owners to remove their vehicles from a Supercharger, after all, if they do not have access to their cars.\nIn a message to Teslarati, Salantiri noted that it would perhaps be best for Tesla to roll out an upper limit for Supercharger idle fees, at least in locations that are valet-only. Or perhaps the electric car maker could just maintain its previous system, which automatically addresses idle fees in places where owners could not disconnect their vehicles from Superchargers. In places like the William Vale Parking Garage, which city dwellers depend on for their charging needs, perhaps Tesla could also roll out Destination Chargers instead, which are not as quick as Urban Superchargers, but do not accrue idle fees once a vehicle is fully charged.\nUpdate:\nThe Model 3 owner has informed us that his vehicle’s idle fees at the William Vale Parking Garage have been waived by Tesla. A representative from the parking garage further explained that an error on Tesla’s backend caused the charge to be levied, but it has been reversed, considering that idle fees do not apply to valet-only Superchargers.\nTesla owner racks up $1147 in Supercharger idle fees at valet-only parking garage\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-09'),

The increase applies over-the-air upgrades for existing Tesla owners who already have some of those features in the Enhanced Autopilot package.\nThe move is the first step in what CEO Elon Musk has promised will be a steady escalation of prices for Teslas Full Self-Driving Capability features on the way to turning the companys products into a fleet of self-driving robo-taxis, Starting Aug. 16, buyers who already have Enhanced Autopilot will have to pay $4,000 rather than the current $3,000 upgrade charge.\nDespite the name, the Full Self-Driving Capability package is not yet capable of driving the car itself. Before the cars can do that, the company has to perfect its Navigate on Autopilot system, which allows Teslas to control speed, follow lanes, and change lanes to drive from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp with minimal driver input as long as the driver is touching the steering wheel. However, various reports have indicated that drivers still have to intervene frequently . The company also has to convince regulators to approve letting its cars on the road without drivers.\nEnhanced Autopilot, an optional package that included adaptive cruise control and active lane control, is no longer offered. Its features have migrated to Full Self-Driving, which is available at extra cost on new Tesla vehicles.\nConsumer Reports Tesla Model 3 Navigate on Autopilot ready for right-lane pass [CREDIT: CR]\nAt that time, Tesla made Autopilot standard, but adaptive cruise control and automatic lane changing are reserved for the Full Self-Driving Capability option, which costs $6,000 when ordered on a new car. Those features, along with automatic parking, summon, automatic lane changes, and a link to the navigation system to enable Navigate on Autopilot make up the current set of features of the Full Self-Driving Capability option.\nMusk tweeted last month that the company would begin ratcheting up prices on the FSD option to reflect the cars higher future earning potential.\nTo be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robo-taxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 8, 2019\nThis price increase represents the first bump up that apparent ladder, and it means buyers will have to pay more for the companys top level of driver-assistance software as the auto industry aims for true full self driving, which may be years away. Effectively, Tesla is adding cost in anticipation of buyers using their cars as taxis to make money, which many drivers wont do.\nLast week, Musk announced that Tesla will begin rolling out a new version of its operating-system software , Version 10, which he said will improve the systems ability to recognize stop signs and lights on surface streets—part of the toolkit that will be necessary for future self-driving features.\nThis piece has been updated to correct several errors referring to features included in Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving.\nTags:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-08'),

Heres an excerpt:\n\"Global Fraud Management is a new team established to promote and foster a culture of ethical behavior and to mitigate fraud, waste, and abuse through prevention, investigation, and remediation. In this role, the ideal candidate would work with key stakeholders to build the global fraud strategy for Tesla and develop a world-class fraud prevention, detection, and response team.\"\nThe listing doesnt say what prompted the creation of this team.\nHowever, Teslas factories have been plagued by waste and disorganization in the past. For example, employees previously told CNBC that they had trouble tracking their project budgets and specific purchase orders within Teslas disparate systems. Others told CNBC they engaged in quick fixes during Model 3 vehicle assembly which Tesla said were not in line with companys official procedures and policies .\nCEO Elon Musk has also espoused the notion that Tesla is besieged by haters, some out to damage the electric vehicle and renewable energy company from within.\nFor instance, in June 2018, Musk sent a pair of e-mails around to all Tesla employees urging them to find and stop turncoats. In one e-mail, Musk asserted:\n\"A Tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations.\"\nIt turned out Musk was referencing Martin Tripp, a former Gigafactory employee who claimed Tesla was using flawed battery manufacturing practices, and hiding relevant info from shareholders. Tripp is still embroiled in a legal battle with Tesla after taking his claims to press.\nIn that same e-mail, Musk told Tesla employees that they are in a battle that could be characterized as Tesla versus the world. He wrote:\n\"As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die. These include Wall Street short sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more. Then there are the oil and gas companies, the wealthiest industry in the world—they dont love the idea of Tesla advancing the progress of solar power and electric cars.\"\nIn another e-mail that week, speaking of one of several paint shop fires that occurred at Teslas Fremont, California factory throughout 2018, Musk said: \"Could just be a random event, but as Andy Grove said, Only the paranoid survive. Please be on the alert for anything thats not in the best interests of our company.\"\nIn November 2018, according to a Department of Justice statement, a former Tesla employee named Salil Parulekar was indicted for allegedly embezzling $9.3 million from Tesla by diverting payments from one supplier to another.\nAnd in the first quarter of 2019, Tesla filed a pair of lawsuits against former employees at self-driving tech venture Zoox, and Chinese electric vehicle makers, Xiaopeng, alleging theft of trade secrets.\nTesla declined to comment for this story. In the past, the company has denied some media reports of waste and fraud in its operations.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-05'),

Car hoods are up and workers tinker around as they try to fix whatever is hampering a car’s performance. Large, multi-drawer tool chests sit alongside more complicated diagnostic equipment. At one car, a couple of service team members work on putting a window back in place.\nWhile the service bay may look familiar, this isn’t your father’s old garage.\nA closer look around reveals that there are no oil stains on the service station floor, probably because these cars don’t need to have their oil changed and oil filters replaced. Instead of a line of cars and trucks rumbling away during state-required smog checks, there is not a whiff of fuel exhaust in the air.\nThis service center has one more difference from your corner garage. It isn’t in an actual garage, but in the automotive technology building at San Jose’s Evergreen Valley College (EVC). And the people working on the cars aren’t officially mechanics.\nThey are EVC students learning the ins and outs of repairing Tesla Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles as part of the Tesla START program, an educational and training partnership between the electric carmaker and EVC that has been set up to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to step directly into jobs at Tesla service centers after they finish their training.\nEVC is one of six community and junior colleges around the country — and the only one in the Bay Area — where Tesla operates its START program. Tesla set up its first such partnership at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, North Carolina, in March 2018, and has since expanded the program to schools in Seattle, Miami, Seiden, New York, and at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, near Los Angeles. To date, almost 200 students have graduated from START programs. (Tesla has said START is not an acronym for anything.)\nEVC launched its START training program earlier this year, and the first cohort of 12 students completed the 12-week course in April. The nine students currently enrolled in the school’s summer START session are set to graduate Aug. 23, with the next cohort expected to included 12 to 15 students when the course begins again Sept. 9.\nManiphone Dickerson, dean of workforce development at EVC, said it was a set of corresponding circumstances that helped the school land Tesla’s START program. Among the factors in EVC’s favor were that it already had a strong automotive training department, and had integrated courses on services for electric-hybrid cars into its curriculum for several years.\n“The relationship with Tesla is very innovative. It’s very next generation,” Dickerson said. “The way it has benefited our students is that it is in line with the future workforce. We are really focused on teaching students for tomorrow’s jobs, and Tesla is the catalyst.”\nTesla doesn’t provide figures about how much it has invested in the START program. As Tesla does with all it START program partners, the company provided EVC with the curriculum, instructors, cars and equipment, and built out the training facility. All EVC had to do was provide shop space on campus, which was already available.\n“It’s a program that benefits us, and Tesla,” Dickerson said. “We get to add a new level of education, and Tesla gets new employees who are already educated and don’t need to train on the job.”\nWhile all of EVC’s current START program members are enrolled in the school’s auto tech work experience course, being enrolled in a community college is not a requirement for the START program as the application process is open to anyone who meets Tesla’s enrollment guidelines .\nAnd when Tesla began scoping out possible locations for its first START program in the Bay Area, the fact that EVC is just a few miles down the highway from Tesla’s Fremont factory was clearly a draw.\n“(START) provides a unique opportunity for students to get specialized technician training in the emerging electric vehicle industry,” said Martti Thomas, Tesla’s manager for North American service training programs. “Partnering with Evergreen Valley College allows us to leverage an established automotive training program right in our backyard.”\nDuring their training, students are also classified as Tesla interns, are paid for their time, and in addition to learning how to service Teslas with daily classroom studies and lab work, they spend at least one day a week “shadowing” Tesla technicians at local Tesla service centers to see how the cars are serviced.\nAccording to Tesla, nearly all of the students who have completed the START program have been placed in jobs at one of the company’s service centers. As long as a student graduates from the program, Tesla will work to immediately match that student with a service center opening.\nEVC students in the current cohort said that the opportunity to be around Teslas in a real-world service environment is one of the reasons why the START stands out from other automotive service training programs.\n“I’ve never experienced that with other trade schools and manufacturers,” said Brandon Christie, of San Jose, an EVC student and START program member who said he is also a five-year veteran of the automotive industry. “We’ve just gone to training, and then you’re hoping you can apply it when you’re working on actual customers’ vehicles after you’ve gotten hired. With this, you do it while you’re training, so right as you’re learning it, you’re doing it, and it really gets pounded into your head.”\nFor Natalie Flores, the START program has led her from the classroom, to the Tesla service center, and back to the classroom, where she is an instructor for the current EVC cohort. Flores said she was in the automotive technician training program at Rio Hondo when the START program began there. Flores got accepted into START, graduated in 2018, worked at a Tesla service center for six months, and then was hired as an instructor at the EVC program in October.\n“I juggle being a manager, and an instructor,” Flores said. “Typically, we make sure to have a lecture depending on what we’re covering for the week. Then we go into our workbooks and those are associated with labs within whatever we are covering. And once we learn about it, we get to practice on it hands-on in the vehicles.”\nFlores said that START students also learn that many of the problems Teslas encounter don’t even require those cars to be brought into a service center. Tesla provides mobile units that technicians take to customers’ homes or workplaces to work on a car. In other cases, Flores says that Tesla’s software allows service team members to diagnose and fix problems remotely.\n“Depending on the customer’s issue, I’d say as much as 90% of repairs could be done over the air,” Flores said. “We utilize our laptops more than anything.”\nFlores said that having automotive industry experience is helpful when applying to the START program, but not a necessity. EVC student Rakee Cromwell said he had no background working on cars when he was studying physics and mathematics at Susquehanna University, in Pennsylvania, when about a year ago, he applied online for the START program.\nRelated Articles\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-02'),

Firms such as ARK Invest, UBS, McKinsey, and Intel believe fully autonomous robotaxis will eventually generate trillions in global revenue.\nEven if full autonomy doesnt happen anytime soon, partial autonomy is a potential source of durable competitive advantage for Tesla over the long term.\nThe next step for Teslas partial autonomy software will be when Tesla uses the full capacity of its new Full Self-Driving Computer, possibly in Q4. Also, future progress in computer vision, behaviour prediction and imitation learning will be interrelated.\nA self-driving car has to continually answer the following question: what will the cars, pedestrians and cyclists around me do over the next five seconds? This problem is called behaviour prediction (or simply prediction). Two prominent self-driving car engineers have recently expressed their belief in the importance of behaviour prediction.\nThe importance of behaviour prediction\nOne is Anthony Levandowski , a former top engineer at Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ). Levandowski is now the CEO of the self-driving car startup Pronto . In a blog post in December, Levandowski expressed his view that the “predictive shortcomings” of self-driving car prototypes are what limit them from achieving “true level 4 or 5 ” autonomy. Levandowski writes:\n...the reason why nobody has achieved this level of functionality is because today’s software is not good enough to predict the future. It’s still nowhere close to matching the instincts of human drivers, which is the single most important factor in road safety.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Levandowski reiterated this idea:\nIf you were to analyze all the disengages that people have done and try to break it down like what’s the actual real reason behind it… all of them were a software failure, and they’re mainly a software failure on mature companies at trying to understand what the vehicle’s gonna [be] doing - or the pedestrians around you - having a misunderstanding or miscommunication with them. And so thats where the value’s gonna be. …right now, the problem is not better lasers. The problem is… prediction.\nA similar view is held by Chris Urmson , who led Waymo from 2013 to 2016 and who now runs the self-driving car startup Aurora . This is what Urmson said in a recent interview with MIT researcher Lex Fridman:\n...if I could wave a magic wand, what part of the system would I make work today to accelerate it as quickly as possible? … It’s really that perception forecasting ability. So, if tomorrow you could give me a perfect model of whats happened, what is happening, and what will happen for the next five seconds around a vehicle on the roadway, that would accelerate things pretty dramatically.\nTesla’s advantage\nCompanies like Waymo and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) are trying to solve behaviour prediction with deep learning , an approach in which deep (i.e., multi-layered) neural networks are trained on large data sets. Neural networks achieve better accuracy with more data, so the more data a company can collect, the better its vehicles will be at behaviour prediction. Andrej Karpathy , Tesla’s Director of AI, explained how this process works at Tesla Autonomy Day :\nWith some applications of deep learning for self-driving cars, such as object detection, companies may suffer from a bottleneck created by the need to pay humans to manually label images or frames of video. (Unless they use self-supervised learning for object detection, but that’s a topic for another article.) With object detection, the data that is inputted into the neural network might be a frame of video that contains a pedestrian. The desired output might be a box drawn around the pedestrian appended with the label “pedestrian.” To train the neural network to do this, it needs to be fed thousands or millions of examples of video frames of pedestrians with boxes drawn around them and the label “pedestrian” appended to those boxes. Humans have to create those examples by looking at frames of video, drawing boxes, and appending labels. This makes neural network training a labour-intensive and therefore costly process. The input-output pairs used for training have to be made by hand.\nWith behaviour prediction, the input data might be what another car did over the last five seconds. The desired output data would be a prediction about what that car will do over the next five seconds. If you have a ten-second recording of what a car did, then you have an input-output pair that can be used for training. You don’t need a human to manually label anything.\nIt may not even be necessary for a company to upload video. Instead, a vehicle can simply save a recording of an abstracted representation of what is going on around it. That abstracted representation might look something like the boxes, lines, and text labels overlaid on this video from Tesla hacker verygreen, as well as the green shading that represents drivable roadway.\nWithout video, it might look something like this:\nTesla’s advantage in behaviour prediction is that it has over 500,000 Hardware 2 and 3 vehicles on the road. Hardware 2 and Hardware 3 vehicles have eight cameras covering 360 degrees, a forward-facing radar, a computer for running neural networks, and the ability to save data while driving and later upload it via customers’ Wi-Fi when parked at home. Particularly if Tesla uploads only the abstracted representations from Hardware 2 and 3 cars, and not raw video, then the fleet is a massive source of training data for behaviour prediction. With abstracted representations, there is no need for humans to do any labelling. Since neural networks improve with more data, this is an advantage for Tesla in behaviour prediction. Since behaviour prediction is so important for autonomous driving, this is an advantage for Tesla in autonomous driving technology.\nData isnt uploaded indiscriminately from the fleet, either. For instance, its particularly valuable to upload an example where a Tesla’s behaviour prediction neural network made a wrong prediction. Training on corrected mistakes is a much quicker way to improve than training on random data. The value of data shouldn’t be measured simply based on the absolute number of examples. Sheer quantity isn’t the goal.\nTake the so-called “long tail” : rare occurrences that might only happen once in a million miles. A company whose fleet drives a billion miles a month (as Teslas will once it reaches about 1 million vehicles) could collect up to 1,000 examples per month of once-in-a-million-mile occurrences. These data sets of rare occurrences would be relatively small yet extremely valuable since dealing with the long tail is critical to autonomous driving.\nThe business impact\nNobody knows for sure when full autonomy will be achieved. It could be next year or it could be more than a decade from now. When full autonomy is achieved, firms such as ARK Invest , UBS ( UBS ), McKinsey , and Intel ( INTC ) believe it will create a robotaxi industry that will eventually grow to trillions in global revenue. Thats why it’s worth diving deep into topics like deep learning, neural networks, and behaviour prediction. If Hardware 3 Teslas achieve full autonomy and can be operated as robotaxis, Tesla’s stock price may increase by more than 20x over the long term, according to a financial model created by ARK Invest.\nCruise, a General Motors ( GM ) subsidiary, is valued at $19 billion today with no revenue. In August 2018, Morgan Stanleys ( MS ) price target for Alphabet valued its subsidiary Waymo at $45 billion , more than Teslas market cap today. The same month Evercore ISI ( EVR ) gave Waymo a discounted present value of $65 billion . Waymo itself has reportedly been seeking outside investors at a valuation “at least several times” that of Cruise. If behaviour prediction is truly the hardest and most important problem for autonomous driving, and if Tesla truly has a major advantage over Waymo and Cruise in behaviour prediction, then analysts and investors should value Teslas opportunity in robotaxis and robotrucks more than they value Waymo or Cruise.\nARK Invests robotaxi valuation forecast from its Big Ideas 2019 report.\nEven if full autonomy never happens, there is an opportunity for Tesla in partial autonomy. Navigate on Autopilot , Enhanced Summon , and future partial autonomy features can differentiate Teslas from all other vehicles. Better behaviour prediction will make these features better. Until other car manufacturers (or possibly a Tier 1 supplier) copy Tesla’s approach of using a huge fleet of mass-produced cars for deep learning (what Tesla calls “fleet learning”), no company’s partial autonomy features will compete. Commentators often think of Tesla just as an electric car maker and argue that incumbents will eventually be able to make better electric cars. But possibly a bigger differentiator from incumbents than an electric powertrain will be Tesla’s partial autonomy software.\nThe company cultures of incumbents are not software-oriented. For example, while Tesla has been doing over-the-air software updates since 2012, incumbents are only now starting to follow suit. Even if incumbents want to emulate Tesla with regard to partial autonomy software, they will likely lag years behind. This is a potential source of durable competitive advantage for Tesla over the long term.\nWhat comes next\nAccording to CEO Elon Musk, Tesla’s current neural networks and other autonomy-related software are only using 5-10% of the computational power of Tesla’s new, custom-designed Full Self-Driving Computer . (Cars with the FSD Computer are referred to as Hardware 3 cars.) Since more computationally intensive neural networks tend to do better on their assigned tasks, it would be logical for Tesla to use the FSD Computer’s full capacity. On the Q3 2018 earnings call, Karpathy said that bigger neural networks were coming, enabled by the FSD Computer. More recently, Musk tweeted that the functionality of cars with the FSD Computer would begin to diverge from that of cars without it in Q4 of this year. Keeping in mind Musk’s confessed and well-documented punctuality problem, we can look to Q4 for the next significant step for Tesla’s autonomy software, but not wait with bated breath.\nThe milestone to watch for is when Tesla starts using all or almost all of the FSD Computer’s power. Karpathy’s public comments suggest to me that his team has been developing new neural networks for some time. The new networks won’t just be bigger, but also architecturally improved (i.e., improved in terms of the types of artificial neurons and their interconnections). The ideal outcome for Tesla would be a sudden, major step up in performance.\nHow vision, prediction, and imitation interrelate\nPerformance of different subsystems may also be interrelated. If a computer vision neural network fails to detect a vehicle, a behaviour prediction neural network that is downstream of object detection will necessarily fail to predict whether the vehicle will cut into the Tesla’s lane. Similarly, the abstracted representations that may be uploaded to train behaviour prediction are only as good as the computer vision networks that generate them. In both training and inference (i.e., the real time application of a neural network on the road), improvements in computer vision may help behaviour prediction.\nThe same idea applies to imitation learning . Tesla has been using imitation learning for path prediction:\nWith imitation learning, the neural network takes some input data: possibly raw video but more likely in my opinion an abstracted representation generated by computer vision networks. The desired output data from the neural network is the action for the car to take, which is translated by the control software into steering, braking, and accelerating commands. With hundreds of thousands of Tesla drivers at the wheel, Tesla can collect abundant output data simply by recording what actions human drivers took. Coupled with the abstracted representation of the car’s surroundings, this constitutes the input-output pair that is used for training. In imitation learning, this input-output pair is referred to as a state-action pair: it includes the state of the world or the environment and the action taken by an agent, such as a human driver.\nImitation learning is similar to behaviour prediction in that the input-output pairs can be generated automatically without any need for humans to manually label the data. With enough state-action pairs, a neural network will learn which states prompt which actions from human drivers. With sufficient training, the neural network will be able to generate those actions on its own. It will thereby learn to drive.\nIf an abstracted representation is used for imitation learning, then reducing computer vision errors will also reduce imitation errors in both training and inference. Moreover, improving behaviour prediction could improve imitation. The input data for imitation need not be limited to what’s generated by the computer vision networks. A behaviour prediction network’s forecasts can be used as additional input data. Waymo’s imitation network, ChauffeurNet , does this. This allows the imitation network to correlate human actions not just to what the computer vision networks see now, but also to what the behaviour prediction networks forecast will happen over the next five seconds.\nTo learn all the correct correlations between environment states and drivers’ actions, the imitation network needs to work with all the same information humans are working with. Humans drive not just based on what we see, but also our ability to anticipate what other humans on the road will do. The computer vision networks attempt to recreate what humans see outside the car that causes them to take certain driving actions. The behaviour prediction networks attempt to recreate the predictive process going on inside the driver’s brain that also causes them to take certain driving actions, such as preemptively stopping for a fast-walking jaywalker before they enter the cars path. (In theory, all this predictive information is latent in what the computer vision networks see, but by the same token, the abstracted representations generated by the vision networks are latent in the raw pixels from the video cameras. Future robots may well generate actions directly from pixels , but for now machine learning engineers tend to prefer to decompose problems into discrete parts like vision, prediction and imitation.)\nSo, an improvement in prediction may translate into an improvement in imitation if prediction is used as an input for imitation. Prediction and imitation, in turn, will likely both be improved by an improvement in vision, which is an input to both. Vision improvements flow downstream to prediction and imitation, and prediction improvements flow downstream to imitation.\nConclusion\nWhen the topic of Tesla’s fleet-wide data collection effort comes up, one of the most common retorts I hear is that Tesla has no advantage because of the cost of hand-labelling images under the standard supervised learning paradigm for computer vision. This retort overlooks behaviour prediction, in which hand-labelling can be avoided entirely. It also overlooks imitation learning, in which hand-labelling is also avoided.\nEven with traditional supervised learning for computer vision, Tesla’s fleet can be used to surface examples of rare objects, rare lighting and weather conditions, and other rare edge cases. For example, a deep neural network that has been trained to recognize horses can run on the car and trigger the cameras to save a snapshot anytime the network thinks it sees a horse. This is a way to get examples of horses, which are a relatively rare class of object.\nA promising future area of research and development for computer vision is self-supervised learning , in which the training signal (i.e., the source of ground truth or evaluation of the neural network’s inferences) comes not from human labellers, but from the data itself. Tesla has been experimenting with self-supervised learning for depth perception:\nI hope we can retire these well-worn arguments:\nIt’s too expensive for Tesla to label much data. (Not all data needs to be labelled, and the rarity of labelled image data also matters, not just the sheer quantity. Deep learning-based upload triggers can be used to surface rare examples.)\nIt’s too expensive for Tesla to upload much data over cellular networks (Data is uploaded via Tesla drivers Wi-Fi.)\nIf Tesla were uploading much data over customers’ Wi-Fi, we would know. (For raw video this may be true, but for abstracted representations this is more dubious. As a point of comparison, Mobileye says it can generate camera-based HD maps from about 16 kilobytes per mile . HD maps dont include road users or driver input like braking, so Teslas abstracted representations would need to be bigger. But even if they were 1,000x bigger, 16 megabytes per mile, Tesla drivers who have observed their cars uploading on the order of 1 gigabyte per month could be contributing up to 60 miles of driving data per month to Teslas training set. Across the whole fleet , that would be 32 million miles per month. These numbers are just for illustrative purposes; the point is that abstracted representations are much more compact than video.)\nMore data just gets you steeply diminishing returns , so it’s practically useless anyway. (This is not true when you go from no examples or very few examples of a rare class to many examples. Also, even with diminishing returns, simply piling on more data has been remarkably effective in instances like OpenAI’s language generation network GPT-2 .)\nSome investors and analysts may find these discussions too in the weeds or even esoteric. Yet Tesla’s future valuation depends quite directly on these somewhat obscure technical issues. Firms like ARK Invest, UBS, McKinsey, and Intel agree that the business opportunity for self-driving cars will eventually be measured in the trillions, although they disagree on the timing of the technology. Others like Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI see the market leader eventually growing into a triple-digit, billion-dollar valuation. My advice to sell-side analyst firms is to hire machine learning analysts (or assign existing ones) to look at Tesla’s potential data advantage relative to Waymo. If what I’ve postulated is correct, sell-side firms may be mispricing Tesla relative to their own valuations of Waymo . That’s my contrarian thesis.\nThis article was written by\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-11'),

I tried my best to be impartial and conservative.\nThe outcome is an intrinsic value below the current price. The market is apparently pricing the best-case scenario.\nThere are upside and downside risks. The risks look skewed to the downside, but further progress in mobility might ease risks and respectively increase the intrinsic value.\nFair valuation involves learning of the little details and the first priority of this article is to identify places there is work still to do. Thanks for your attention.\nSource: Electrek.com\nThe question about Teslas (NASDAQ: TSLA ) valuation is whether it should be a multiple of a technology company or an automaker. Professor Damodaran mentioned this in his recent article about Teslas valuation:\nThis is a pricing, not a valuation...An intrinsic valuation requires forecasting cash flows over time, after taxes and reinvestment, and then discounting those cash flows back at a rate that reflects the risk in the investment. A pricing usually involves picking a metric (revenues, earnings, EBITDA), picking a forecast year for the metric and applying a multiple based upon what other companies in the peer group trade at.\nChallenge accepted.\nAutomotive segment\nEV production is the core segment of this company. In the past, Tesla succeeded in EV engineering and design solutions. However, in 2019, there are quite a few decent competitive models from producers like Porsche ( OTCPK:POAHF ) and Audi. Increasing competition has negatively affected sales of highly marginal models S and X. Tesla could not introduce any significant upgrades for these models because of a tight financial situation after the SolarCity acquisition and Tesla 3s development. Sales of S and X were 43% lower in 1H19 than in the same period a year ago. Auto giants stand out with high-quality standards for manufacturing and aftermarket service - valuable characteristics for premium-class cars.\nThe companys market share used in the valuation is 13%. In the local US market, its share could be much higher, about 20-25%.\nSources: Companys data, Estimates\nTeslas pickups and semis are not included in the valuation. Model Y does not differ much from model 3. Hence, it is just model 3 for simplicity.\nWith an increasing share of model 3 in overall sales, the ASP will drift lower. The reasonably looking level in the long run supported by a self-driving option is likely about $41,000 per car. The gross margin in the automotive segment will be at the 18% level, which is close to the average level for auto manufacturers. However, in the short-term, the gross margin will be at a lower level of 13-14%. The company will be facing difficulties to stay profitable in the automotive segment in the next two years. Investors should be ready for this.\nSources: Companys data, Estimates\nThe earnings report for 2Q19 came roughly in line with the forecasted numbers. Teslas operating loss at $167m was slightly better than the number in the model (-$181m). The selling price for model 3 was at the $50k level compared to the models $49.3k. It increased confidence in my assessment of Teslas business. The market likely overreacted on 2Q19 results, which were rather neutral. It would be too optimistic to expect Tesla to make a profit this year or even in the next two years. The company keeps relying on external sources of capital.\nThe surprise was in CapEx number, which got to an even lower level than the quarter before. Given such low investments, the company managed to achieve significant free cash flow. It looks like an unstable situation, though, because there is an urge for service and logistics improvement. There should be a more reasonable level for CapEx going forward. Meanwhile, Tesla is trying to convince investors that even with such low investments, the company is making progress. Shanghai Gigafactorys pictures in the quarters update look impressive.\nSource: Tesla second-quarter 2019 update\nIn the base-case scenario, I value the automotive segment at $141 per share after discounting the forecasted cash flows given WACC is equal to 13% and the terminal growth rate is equal to zero. In the base-case scenario, EV sales will get above 13m per year in 2030 and 37.5m in 2040. However, there are opinions that are more positive. For the best case, the forecast is almost 19m EVs in 2030 and 52m in 2040.\nThe discount rate (WACC) is relatively high (13%) because of many company risks: 1) managements execution; 2) lawsuits; 3) strange upper management exodus from the company; 4) unpredictable CEO behavior; 5) M&A; 6) operating risks; 7) regulations; 8) trade wars; and 9) finally, access to capital markets. However, I am still not comfortable with Teslas current strategy to cut prices to support higher volumes sales. Without any significant cost reduction, it will rely on capital markets for the next several years. After a successful raise in May, Tesla showed its ability to attract capital, but it would be different in case of a depressed economic situation. Hence, Damodarans probability of failure used in his calculation for Teslas valuation looks appropriate for my assessment. The last time, he took a 20% probability of failure (bankruptcy). I assume a 10% probability. If Tesla shows progress in its self-driving capabilities, investors will keep investing in it. Recent IPOs of Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ) were success stories because of very high interest in the ride-hailing market. Tesla has the potential to become a player here.\nThe final assessment of the automotive segments value comes at $134 per share in the base-case and $192 per share in the best-case scenario.\nSources: Estimates\nService, Energy, Superchargers\nAt the moment, these are the loss-making segments. The best chances to turn into tiny profits are in the energy segment (excluding SolarCity). This sector provided just $33m of losses in 1Q19. With expected growth in energys revenue in the nearest future, operating income might become positive. It is a highly competitive market and its profitability will hardly be significant. The selling price is steadily following the improvement in production costs.\nSources: Companys data, Estimates\nService will probably have gotten from negative gross margins only by the end of 2020. It will be merely a zero margin. The management has tried unsuccessfully to transfer all the sales online in 1Q19. The operating losses from service activity were $193m in 1Q19.\nSupercharger capacity has grown to roughly 1,600 charging locations worldwide in 2Q19. Here is the problem, Tesla is not an exclusive provider. Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VWAGY ) will launch 500 locations in the US this year according to its plan. For instance, Tesla had to cut supercharger prices back down by 10% globally at the beginning of 2019 due to less competitive rates comparing to some third-party charging stations, according to this Electrek article . It seems there is no pricing power for Tesla.\nTogether, these, related to EV sales, segments are valued at $23.6 per share.\nSolarCity\nAcquired in 2016, the CEOs family-related business was seemingly a rescue operation. SolarCity cannot compete with the effective local players. Apparently, its strategy was based on claiming a 30% state tax credit. Tesla has lost more than $1.25bn since the acquisition because of the negative free cash flow in SolarCity. The gross margin risks falling into negative territory in 2020. It cannot be valued as a going-concern entity. However, it has substantial liquidation value (excluding related debt on Teslas balance sheet), which was assessed roughly at $16 per share.\nSources: Companys data, Estimates\nMobility\nIt is the most attractive segment in the company, and it does not even exist now. The potential addressable market and strong profitability make investors highly interested and highly attracted to the story.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, Tesla launched Autopilot 2.0 and months later a slightly improved 2.5 hardware version. Teslas new sensing suite consisted and still consists today of 8 surround cameras, 1 forward-facing radar, and 12 upgraded ultrasonic sensors. The front-radar provides a 250m long-range detection. In 2018 Tesla announced that it would shift to an internally developed chip (\"hardware 3\") during the first-half 2019.\nBelow are the full quotes from the \"Tesla Case Study\" in Citis comprehensive research \"Car of the Future\" that was very important for this analysis:\nAhead of the hardware 3 upgrade, in the fall of 2018 Tesla rolled out its next generation Autopilot software stack (V9) on the 2.0/2.5 sensing suites. The V9 update opened all 8 cameras and expanded the neural net detection to apparently include vehicles at various angles, some degree of pedestrian detection, some degree of free space and, importantly, blind spot detection thanks to the expanded camera coverage. From a sensing and human-machine interface (HMI) perspective, V9 was a step-function improvement versus the prior software stack, but still lacked a functioning DMS system, detections for traffic lights and traffic signs (road barriers possibly too), as well as HD mapping to augment on board sensors. Some of these detections are expected to be introduced in 2019 under Teslas new Hardware 3 compute platform. Assuming Tesla can achieve this, its sensing capabilities should be able to match or even exceed competing systems. However, the lack of sensor redundancy will remain an issue - while Tesla could possibly upgrade its existing sensors, adding surround radars and/or LiDAR could prove more difficult as a retrofit. So once Tesla launches its Hardware 3 compute in 2019, it will be interesting to see whether Tesla decides to upgrade Autopilot 2.0/2.5 sensors or introduce an entirely new Autopilot 3.0 sensing suite perhaps with greater sensing redundancy. It will also be interesting to see whether Hardware 3 allows Tesla to unlock the apparent DMS system located in the rearview mirror.\nWe regard Autopilot in its current form as still a level-2+ highway autonomous feature. For highway driving, driving policy is less complex than an urban environment with right/left turns and pedestrians crossing. Clearly, Teslas focus on vehicle and lane detection over traffic light/sign detection is partly a function of the intended use case being highways mainly.\nTeslas sensing suite is known as the one who didnt pick LiDAR. We do not believe Tesla is aiming to launch urban RoboTaxis, which partly explains why LiDAR wasnt chosen. Rather, we think Teslas AV aspirations are more aligned with our AV Sub concept, so from that perspective Teslas sensing suite can be viewed as a competitive choice aimed at establishing the lowest cost AV system with the highest amounts of usable data (OTA) and with an early mover advantage with a popular EV. For Tesla this is a capability versus cost equation. The AP2.0/2.5 hardware clearly has a cost advantage over more redundant systems, but the question is whether the presumed domain limitations will come at a significant cost to Tesla in the AV race. In other words, is AP 2.0/2.5 even good enough to achieve a stage-1 AV Sub model? The answer isnt clear at the moment but right now wed say probably not. This is particularly true as we continue to see sensing improvements in both radar and LiDAR. Now, Tesla can of course upgrade its sensing-suite with hardware 3.0, but the company might then have to contend with customer/legal pushback on having sold many vehicles with the promise of full autonomy on Autopilot 2.0/2.5 hardware. This will be a very interesting storyline to follow in 2019 as Tesla looks to upgrade to its internally-developed Hardware 3 chip.\nAt the beginning of July, there was an announcement that old cars, having sold with the FSD option, would be recalled and upgraded with a new Tesla chip. It is a very important step for the company to move to the next level of self-driving technologies. Tesla has been selling full self-driving promises for years with the hardware whose capabilities are apparently limited by level 2+ maximum. This pursuit of quick money looks like a barrier on the way to further ambitions given the risks of mass lawsuits from FSD buyers.\nTo build an AV subscription system, Tesla just needs a working enhanced summoning option with a wide radius and a 99% success rate (or as Mr. Musk likes to say \"99.999%\"). In the beginning, the system might not be even working properly. The company seems to have an extensive fan-base that would subscribe to the prime Tesla club even in a beta-test regime. Tesla has already been focusing on developing the summoning feature. The newer enhanced Summon feature will \"come find you anywhere in a parking lot\", according to the company.\nIn the ride-hailing market, Tesla could hold roughly a 5% share.\nSources: Goldman Sachs Research, Estimates\nIt is hard to expect from the company to make progress in the nearest future though. Tesla is in a complicated financial situation, while it keeps on trying to achieve sustainable profitability with its core segment. The recalling and upgrading of so many cars looks like a costly business. Regulation issues should be considered as well, and managements execution could be bumpy with some mistakes on the road ahead.\nSources: Companys data, Estimates\nGiven all the assumptions for a monthly subscription fee and the companys costs (insurance, repairs and even a whole battery change in the middle of EVs life), the gross margins might be above 40% and lowering to 30% in the long run.\nGiven a high level of uncertainty at this moment, it looks prudent to correct the segments valuation for a probability of success (60% in my opinion). The final segments value came at $79 per share in the base-case scenario and $97 per share in the scenario with a substantially higher subscription fee. The discount and growth rates are the same as for the automotive segment valuation.\nSources: Estimates\nBottom Line\nThere is an attractiveness in the mobility segment. With more progress in this direction and lower uncertainty, the value for the whole company would be much higher. At the current stage, the companys focus is on gaining scale in its core automotive segment to achieve stable profitability. In the nearest future, Tesla keeps on relying on external sources of capital, which might be needed as soon as the next year with a normalized level of capital expenditures.\nThe sum-of-the-parts value for the base-case scenario (including net debt = $68 per share) is $185 per share. The market is apparently pricing the best-case ($265 per share) scenario and can keep doing that. As a result, I honestly could not find strong reasons to be long or short this stock now. On the one hand, there are so many risks around this company that their description will take another article. The calculated intrinsic value is significantly lower than the current price. On the other hand, even Damodarans valuations for this company have been below the markets price for the last 2-3 years. The market has been pricing the best-case scenario for Tesla for a while it seems.\nRisks are skewed to the downside for Teslas shares.\nSources: Bloomberg, Estimates\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-10'),

The IIHS later shared an image of the vehicle that it will use for its crash tests: a blue Model 3 with black interior and 18″ wheels. The organization added that next week’s test will include a side crash test.\nTests of the 2019 Tesla Model 3 commence next week with the side crash test. pic.twitter.com/yXtbGDC9h9\n— IIHS (@IIHS_autosafety) August 7, 2019\nInterestingly, the vehicle that the IIHS will use for its upcoming crash tests does not seem to be the same Model 3 that was used when the group conducted preliminary safety tests on the vehicle last year. It should be noted that in May 2018, the IIHS has performed preliminary safety tests on a red Long Range Model 3 RWD, which was the only available variant of the electric sedan at the time.\nThe results were impressive then, with the group giving the Model 3 a “Superior” score for front crash prevention in its crash avoidance and mitigation category. This was primarily due to the Model 3’s suite of safety features, including its low-speed autobrake, and its high-speed autobrake systems. Nevertheless, the electric sedan did not receive a flawless rating from the IIHS in its preliminary tests, due to the Model 3’s low beams exhibiting a 15.2% glare during straightaways.\nThe 2018 Tesla Model 3 now earns a good rating for its standard LED reflector headlights for models built after June 2018. Previous models earn an acceptable rating. https://t.co/EUWXFLBnkm pic.twitter.com/TOctSTGaAl\n— IIHS (@IIHS_autosafety) December 26, 2018\nThis rating was eventually adjusted and raised in December 2018, when the IIHS announced on Twiter that the Model 3’s headlights, which were improved and updated by Tesla, have been given a “Good” rating . The organization noted in its December announcement that the Model 3 headlights’ higher rating was reflective of electric sedans that were produced after June 2018.\nTesla has rolled out improvements to the Model 3 since the IIHS’ latest update on the vehicle last December. Considering that the IIHS’ teaser on Twitter featured what appeared to be a separate car from the Model 3 it tested last year, the group could very well be evaluating a newer build of the electric car. Hopefully, this is the case, as this would allow the IIHS to provide a safety rating on the Model 3 that is especially accurate of vehicles that are being produced today.\nThis could ultimately bode well for Tesla and its midsize electric sedan. As noted by Elon Musk, improvements to the company’s vehicles are rolled out as soon as they are ready . Thus, the Model 3 that the IIHS will be testing next week will likely feature improvements over the Model 3 that the group tested in May 2018 and December 2018 (provided that the vehicle was a newer build, of course). The results of the safety group’s tests next week will likely hold the answer.\nTesla Model 3 to undergo crash safety tests with the IIHS next week\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-08'),

And almost all of them use lidar, a type of sensor that uses lasers to build a three-dimensional map of the world around the car.\nBut Tesla CEO Elon Musk argues that these companies are making a big mistake.\n\"Theyre all going to dump lidar,\" Elon Musk said at an April event showcasing Teslas self-driving technology. \"Anyone relying on lidar is doomed.\"\n\"Lidar is really a shortcut,\" added Tesla AI guru Andrej Karpathy. \"It sidesteps the fundamental problems of visual recognition that is necessary for autonomy. It gives a false sense of progress, and is ultimately a crutch.\"\nIn recent weeks I asked a number of experts about these claims. And I encountered a lot of skepticism.\n\"In a sense all of these sensors are crutches,\" argued Greg McGuire, a researcher at MCity, the University of Michigans testing ground for autonomous vehicles. \"Thats what we build, as engineers, as a society—we build crutches.\"\nSelf-driving cars are going to need to be extremely safe and reliable to be accepted by society, McGuire said. And a key principle for high reliability is redundancy. Any single sensor will fail eventually. Using several different types of sensors makes it less likely that a single sensors failure will lead to disaster.\n\"Once you get out into the real world, and get beyond ideal conditions, theres so much variability,\" argues industry analyst (and former automotive engineer) Sam Abuelsamid. \"Its theoretically possible that you can do it with cameras alone, but to really have the confidence that the system is seeing what it thinks its seeing, its better to have other orthogonal sensing modes\"—sensing modes like lidar.\nAdvertisement\nCamera-only algorithms can work surprisingly well\nEnlarge / Elon Musk in 2015.\nODD ANDERSEN/AFP/Getty Images\nOn April 22, the same day Tesla held its autonomy event, a trio of Cornell researchers published a research paper that offered some support for Musks claims about lidar. Using nothing but stereo cameras, the computer scientists achieved breakthrough results on KITTI, a popular image recognition benchmark for self-driving systems. Their new technique produced results far superior to previously published camera-only results—and not far behind results that combined camera and lidar data.\nUnfortunately, media coverage of the Cornell paper created confusion about what the researchers had actually found. Gizmodos writeup, for example, suggested the paper was about where cameras are mounted on a vehicle—a topic that wasnt even mentioned in the paper. (Gizmodo re-wrote the article after researchers contacted them.)\nTo understand what the paper actually showed, we need a bit of background about how software converts raw camera images into a labeled three-dimensional model of a cars surroundings. In the KITTI benchmark, an algorithm is considered a success if it can accurately place a three-dimensional bounding box around each object in a scene.\nSoftware typically tackles this problem in two steps. First, the images are run through an algorithm that assigns a distance estimate to each pixel. This can be done using a pair of cameras and the parallax effect. Researchers have also developed techniques to estimate pixel distances using a single camera. In either case, a second algorithm uses depth estimates to group pixels together into discrete objects, like cars, pedestrians, or cyclists.\nFurther Reading\nHow computers got shockingly good at recognizing images\nThe Cornell computer scientists focused on this second step. Most other researchers working on camera-only approaches have represented the pixel data as a two-dimensional image, with distance as an additional value for each pixel alongside red, green, and blue. Researchers would then typically run these two-dimensional images through a convolutional neural network (see our in-depth explainer here ) that has been trained for the task.\nAdvertisement\nBut the Cornell team realized that using a two-dimensional representation was counterproductive because pixels that are close together in a two-dimensional image might be far apart in three-dimensional space. A vehicle in the foreground, for example, might appear directly in front of a tree thats dozens of meters away.\nSo the Cornell researchers converted the pixels from each stereo image pair into the type of three-dimensional point cloud that is generated natively by lidar sensors. The researchers then fed this \"pseudo-lidar\" data into existing object recognition algorithms that are designed to take a lidar point cloud as an input.\n\"You could close the gap significantly\"\nEnlarge\nAurich / Getty\n\"Our approach achieves impressive improvements over the existing state-of-the-art in image-based performance,\" they wrote. In one version of the KITTI benchmark (\"hard\" 3-D detection with an IoU of 0.5), for example, the previous best result for camera-only data was an accuracy of 30%. The Cornell team managed to boost this to 66%.\nIn other words, one reason that cameras plus lidar performed better than cameras alone had nothing to do with the superior accuracy of lidars distance measurements. Rather, it was because the \"native\" data format produced by lidar happened to be easier for machine-learning algorithms to work with.\n\"What we showed in our paper is you could close the gap significantly\" by converting camera-based data into a lidar-style point cloud, said Kilian Weinberger, a co-author of the Cornell paper, in a phone interview.\nStill, Weinberger acknowledged, \"theres still a fair margin between lidar and non-lidar.\" We mentioned before that the Cornell team achieved 66% accuracy on one version of the KITTI benchmark. Using the same algorithm on actual lidar point cloud data produced an accuracy of 86%.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-06'),

However, his most recent project has him playing Dr. Frankenstein (electricity inference intended) on a different kind of vehicle altogether: A classic Model A Rat Rod. Using his electric vehicle know-how and gearhead ambition, Benoit is converting the Model A to run off the power of an electric motorcycle.\nAs part of a detailed video exploring electric vehicle (EV) conversions posted on his YouTube channel called, “ The UGLY Truth Behind Electric Vehicle Conversions ,” Benoit removed the Chevy 305 engine from a 1930s Model A Rat Rod he’d purchased for his own attempt. Since using Tesla replacement parts for the car would be incredibly expensive, he decided a budget EV conversion using junk parts would be a better route to take for the sake of his and his audience’s wallets. Then, as part of a separate effort, Benoit purchased a salvaged Zero motorcycle for $3,200 intended for restoration, much like his Tesla salvage projects. Unfortunately, he gradually became uninterested in the project for both personal and practicality reasons thanks to the condition of the bike.\nThe motorcycle and the Model A combination eventually became Benoit’s new source of project inspiration, and he’s currently in the process of combining the Rat Rod body with the electric motor parts of the motorcycle. In a video released today titled, “ I’m building the most BIZARRE electric vehicle conversion ,” Benoit revealed the process taken to create an adaptor plate to mount the electric motor to the Model A’s transmission and a coupler to connect the motor shaft to the transmission.\nThe coupler fabricated for Rich Benoit’s Model A Rat Rod EV conversion. | Image: Rich Benoit/YouTube\nRich Benoit’s Model A Rat Rod before the EV conversion. | Image: Rich Benoit/YouTube\nThe mounting plate fabricated for Rich Benoit’s Model A Rat Rod EV conversion. | Image: Rich Benoit/YouTube\nRich Benoit working on his Model A Rat Rod EV conversion. | Image: Rich Benoit/YouTube\nRich Benoit working on his Model A Rat Rod EV conversion. | Image: Rich Benoit/YouTube\nAlthough at first glance, a hot rod conversion might seem unusual for a private mechanic who built a reputation on raising the ire of the best selling electric vehicle brand in the world, Benoit is really following the latest trend in the DIY automotive crowd. While discussing his Tesla projects with Joe Rogan on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in April, Benoit described the value of Tesla parts from salvaged vehicles .\n“They’re so valuable, man, because…you know why?” he explained. “The battery technology and the motor technology Tesla’s using, everyone’s just dying for that stuff, man.” Rogan then asked whether those electric car parts were put into older vehicles, and a resounding ‘yes’ was the answer from Benoit. “Absolutely. It’s the new generation of hot rodders.”\nA number of electric conversions have made headlines in the last few months, including a Ford Mustang, F-150, and a Porsche 912. One shop, in particular, EV West in San Marcos, California , has turned the hobby into a profitable art form with well-engineered conversions of classic cars for customers around the country. The popularity of the hobby has even led EV West to develop a conversion kit product line. Of course, the spirit of Rich Rebuilds is decidedly unenthusiastic about the kind of money involved in an off-the-shelf conversion, hence the budget Rat Rod approach.\nBenoit has worked on a Tesla-specific conversion himself recently alongside another famous YouTube personality, Simone Giertz. Together with a few other knowledgeable collaborators, Giertz and Benoit converted Giertz’s Tesla Model 3 into a pickup truck aptly named the “Truckla.” The Rich Rebuilds star was specifically tasked with building the truck bed and working on its high voltage components, safety systems, and other electronic features.\nWatch Part 1 of Rich Benoit’s Rat Rod EV conversion below:\nTesla rebel mechanic Rich Rebuilds is electrifying a Ford Model A ‘Rat Rod’\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-03'),

One such vehicle provided a reminder of this during a drag racing session, as the car humbled two notable competitors while running the high-10s.\nThe vehicle in question was a 2017 Tesla Model S P100D that’s strikingly wrapped in matte silver. Initially, the electric car was challenged by a Ford Mustang 5.0, which ended up jumping far too early in what appeared to be an attempt at getting a headstart on the Model S. This proved to be futile as the pre-Raven P100D quickly caught up and overtook its gas-guzzling rival.\nDespite being beaten off the line by the seemingly over-enthusiastic Mustang driver, the Model S came away with the win, hitting the quarter-mile mark in 11.11 seconds at 119.65 mph. The Mustang did well for its part, finishing the race in 12.89 seconds at 112.42 mph.\nAs noted by YouTube’s victoryredcolorado channel, the Tesla Model S P100D owner was “done being the nice guy” after its race with the Mustang 5.0. Ludicrous Mode enabled, the pre-Raven Model S P100D faced another challenger in the form of a B8 Supercharged Audi S4, which was equipped with a V6 engine rated at 333 hp. The S4 had a curb weight of around 3900 lbs, far lighter than the Tesla’s 4,941 pounds.\nThe Audi S4 finished the quarter-mile in 12.77 seconds at 112.92 mph, which was very respectable but not enough to beat the pre-Raven Model S P100D. In comparison, the flagship Tesla sedan completed the race in 10.91 seconds at 117.9  mph. That’s still notably impressive, and well into the territory of exotic vehicles like the Pagani Huayra (10.9 secs) and the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta (10.8 secs).\nThe Tesla Model S has only gone better with age. With its recent Raven updates , which introduced a 370-mile range, better charging, an updated drive unit, and new suspension (among others), a Model S Performance was able to clock in a 10.6-second quarter-mile at 127.55 mph straight out of the factory.

Below is an excerpt from the job listing .\n“Global Fraud Management is a new team established to promote and foster a culture of ethical behavior and to mitigate fraud, waste, and abuse through prevention, investigation, and remediation. In this role, the ideal candidate would work with key stakeholders to build the global fraud strategy for Tesla and develop a world-class fraud prevention, detection, and response team,” the company wrote.\nTesla is yet to issue a statement about the creation of its anti-fraud and waste team.\nThe creation of the new team bodes well for the electric car maker. As noted by CNBC , Tesla’s factories have reportedly dealt with waste issues in the past, particularly during high-intensity periods such as the Model 3 ramp and the company’s end-of-quarter delivery initiatives. Musk has been quite clear about his stance on fraud as well, as evidenced by the company’s legal actions against former employee Martin Tripp, who allegedly attempted to sabotage the electric car maker by sending proprietary company information to outside entities and misreporting to the media .\nAnd it’s not just Tripp, either. In November 2018, a statement from the Department of Justice revealed that Salil Parulekar, a former Tesla employee, was indicted for allegedly embezzling $9.3 million from the electric car maker by diverting payments from suppliers. Tesla has also filed lawsuits against former employees who were later employed by autonomous driving startup Zoox and Chinese carmaker XPeng over alleged thefts of trade secrets .\nWith a Global Fraud Management team in place, Tesla will hopefully be able to foster a workplace that is more optimized and effective. This could play a notable part in the near future, particularly in the Fremont factory, which is currently being tooled for its highest-volume vehicle to date, the Model Y . Together with other upcoming vehicles such as the Pickup Truck, the Semi, and the new Roadster, the Model Y will require Tesla to operate in a manner that involves far less waste, and preferably avoiding fraud altogether in the process.\nTesla’s recent job listing reveals creation of dedicated anti-fraud and waste team\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-06'),

He has been working on the Li-ion batteries pretty much since they were invented. He is credited for helping increase the life cycle of the cells, which helped their commercialization.\nHis work now focuses mainly on a potential increase in energy density and durability, while also decreasing the cost.\nIn 2016, Dahn transitioned his research group from their 20-year research agreement with 3M to a new association with Tesla under the newly formed ‘NSERC/Tesla Canada Industrial Research’.\nThrough the agreement, Tesla invested in a new research lab close to Dahn’s group near Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nMore recently, we reported on a new patent that could help prevent cell failure in Tesla vehicles.\nIn an interview with YouTuber Sean Mitchell, the scientist talks about his latest research and answers a few interesting questions about batteries:\nElectrek’s Take\nInterestingly, Tesla wasn’t mentioned at all during the interview and I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla was off the table since Dahn has let things out of the bag about Tesla before .\nA few things of note in the interview include the mention of removing cobalt from battery cells , which is one of Tesla’s goals.\nDahn is also on board with the latest projections that battery cell cost should go below $100 kWh within the next few years.\nThe milestone has been described as the tipping point that makes battery-electric vehicles cost-competitive with gasoline cars on a massive scale.\nI also found it interesting how Dahn has a very similar approach to Elon Musk when it comes to evaluating new battery technologies. He said:\n“Until you put it in a prototype and you demonstrate that it’s a manufacturable item and economically viable, you can’t jump and down too much”\nThat’s something we hear Elon say a lot every time new battery technologies are announced.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The basic version is also sharp to drive, with quick steering responses, a well-judged ride leaning toward poise over plushness and sound body control on tricky roads.\nBrake feel isn’t as good as it could be, as Tesla needs to balance mechanical brake discs and calipers with harvesting energy through the rear electric motor to keep the battery topped up.\nKeen drivers shouldn’t dismiss the standard Model 3 out of hand, as a 240 kilogram weight advantage, more comfortable ride (on 18-inch wheels) and better steering feel compared to the top version make it a delight on winding back roads.\nThe Tesla Model 3 has arrived in Australia.\nHighway driving is even easier thanks to its Autopilot suite. Recently recognised as the highest-scoring driver assistance pack by ANCAP, Tesla says it is “more capable than the regulatory environment allows”, and will offer “full self-driving” when legal.\nFull self driving costs $8500 and may never be approved for road use, which has raised more than a few eyebrows.\nThe interior isn’t as luxe as its rivals.\nFor now, the car will steer itself for around 20 seconds at a time on highways, or much longer if you leave a lazy hand on the wheel. It works well in traffic jams, able to go, stop and steer within its own lane — though it does require a firm hand when confused by roadwork or intersections.\nDrivers who roam over long distances are well served by Tesla’s Supercharger network which includes more than 30 fast-charging sites around Australia.\nThe entry-level Model 3 is priced from $66,000.\nThe Model 3’s claimed 460 kilometre range can receive a 270km boost in 30 minutes at Supercharger stations, with charging rates slowing as the 50kWh battery nears capacity. Our test example took on more than 150km in around 20 minutes at a cost of $8.82, or $0.42 per kWh.\nCharging at home outside peak hours could cost half as much but take much longer.\nWithout a wall box installed (which owners get for free), the Model 3 needed more than 17 hours to go from a 45 per cent charge to a full battery using a household power point.\nAussie customers first put down a $1500 deposit more than three years ago.\nImportantly, the Model 3 is cheaper to run than rivals. BMW’s $70,900 330i sedan uses 6.4L/100km of premium unleaded, with 150km of range costing about $14 at the bowser, or about $5 more than the Tesla. BMW service plans priced from $1,565 to $4,107 over five years are likely to prove much more expensive than the electric alternative.\nBut traditional luxury car fans might take issue with a plain cabin and sub-par fit-and-finish in the Tesla.\nVerdict 4/5\nTruly innovative, brilliant to drive and practical, the Tesla Model 3 makes a strong case for electric car ownership.\nTesla Model 3 vitals\nPrice: From $66,000 plus on-roads\nEngine: 225kW electric motor\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07'),

But it looks like the automotive industry is starting to take responsibility, as manufacturers enter the 21st century and catch up with the electric trend. BMW recently launched an all-electric luxury SUV, while Nissan is a leading contender with the Nissan Leaf and Ford’s leading electric vehicle is the Ford Focus Electric, based on recent statistics by Energy Sage .\nADVERTISEMENT\nElectric vehicle sales are predicted to rise by 28% in 2019, according to figures by TrendForce in its latest Global Automotive Market Decode. But when it comes to classic cars, you’d assume there is not much you can do to make them sustainable, as their motors are firmly out of date. Vintage car collecting is hugely popular all over the world. In the UK alone, revenue generated is over £5.5 billion per year, according to the most recent National Historic Vehicle Survey . Fortunately, as of late, a ‘retro-electric’ phenomenon has cropped up, as the Guardian called it in 2016 , to make petrol powered cars eco-friendly.\nPorsche classic cars\nThe duo turning vintage Porsches electric\nAnd offering you the chance to do it too. Zelectric Motors , a vintage car refurbisher, has collaborated with EV West , who deal in electric vehicle conversion and car parts, to create a Tesla-powered Porsche 912. Combining the beauty of a classic car with the technology of the future is the most recent passion project of the two respective founders, Americans David Bernardo and Michael Bream.\nThe pair discuss the challenge of converting such a small vehicle into electric form in an interview with Verge magazine , which discusses the Porsche’s unique elements in more detail. What was once a rusty, old model has become a reborn Tesla-powered car with a range of around 140 miles. Michael Bream said:\n“[It was] a little bit of a challenge, engineering-wise because the car is much smaller than the cars that we’re pulling the components out of. A Tesla drive unit comes out of a 5,500-pound car, and we’re trying to shoehorn into about a 2,300-pound car. So there’s a lot of engineering challenges there.”\nPerhaps the best part about the collaboration is that the duo plans to sell Porsche 912 conversion kits, according to the same source. The kits will be available to buy for around $50,000 US dollars and aim to be highly desirable to vintage car collectors with an interest in sustainability.\nHow sustainable is Porsche as a car company?\nEarlier this year, Porsche showcased its first debut of the Porsche Taycan at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The all-electric vehicle can “cruise at 162mph for miles without battery heatstroke” while leaving a “virtually invisible CO2 footprint”, claim Car Magazine . According to Bloomberg , Porsche has already secured nearly 30,000 deposits for the Taycan. The model will be released officially in 2020, costing £120,000, say Car Magazine.\nPorsche\nThe luxury car brand take its sustainable responsibility seriously, offering consumers the chance to offset their CO2 emissions from driving through a ‘Porsche Impact’ scheme which directly funds environmental projects around the world. It also advises on how to recycle old vehicles , as well as automotive batteries at designated recycling facilities.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-05'),

Early July outside of Truckee, California, in Tahoe heading on 80 West.\nHere’s the video on Youtube:\nPowers said that the truck attempted to do it twice, and he appeared to be targeting his vehicle.\nUpdate: Here’s another and a probably better example of a Tesla vehicle being coal rolled sent to Electrek by a reader:\nElectrek’s Take\nI have seen clearer examples of people targeting specific bikes and cars when roll-coaling.\nIn this example, it looks like the Tesla was too far behind to be the target. It looks like the truck was just trying to pass the car in the center lane.\nPowers said that it was the second time the truck was doing it, and previously, it was doing it without having to pass someone.\nEither way, it’s ridiculous to have this modification done in the first place. Even if they are not trying to spew the exhaust on someone, it’s still awful and inconsiderate.\nSome people do it to improve the bad fuel economy of those trucks and reduce the high maintenance cost of the filtering system, but there’s a limit to it.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-06'),

Not long ago we saw the Model 3 compared against the new 3 Series and now we’re looking at another comparison, this time between a Model X and a BMW X5 . It seems like BMWs are definitely the preferred brand to compare to the Model X. Why? Because in certain segments, BMW models used to dominate.\nNow, as far as comparing an electric car to an internal combustion one goes, you know what I think: it’s not fair for both sides. However, these two are still SUVs and both are meant to haul entire families out for shorter or longer trips. Furthermore, let’s not forget, both have six-digit price tags. So how to they stack up against each other? The guys from Throttle House decided to try and figure out which one is better for them.\nThe Model X feels like it comes from the future. It’s a bold move from Tesla, one where they threw convention out the window and went for a different approach. The Falcon doors are pretty cool and they allow you to get in the third row of seats without issue. For some people though, they might be a bit too much, as they do attract a lot of attention. As far as the build quality goes, as some people have complained about that, things don’t look that bad, according to these reviewers.\nIn the X5 you know what you’re getting. This isn’t the first SUV BMW ever made and it shows. The build quality is extraordinary, the materials used inside exemplary and everything’s just how you’d expect it to be. Furthermore, the X5 has a V8 and that means it’s more fun to drive, according to Throttle House.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07'),

Tesla, the US auto maker credited to boosting EV culture in various countries, is also accustomed to this. One such Indian engineer who worked there, now aims big back in India with a new (and his own) startup named Srivaru Motors. The goal? To produce the country’s first ever electric sports bike.\nA Coimbatore-based firm, Srivaru Motors recently revealed its plans to launch such a performance bike by the festive season. Mohanraj Ramasamy is the brains behind this. Having an experience of working for Tesla, the engineer now plans of his own EV business in India.\nAs for the motorcycle being promised here, the company has named it Prana and is gunning for an electric equivalent of a 300cc petrol engine motorcycle. The trademark has already been registered and interestingly, even several of the performance figures of the bikes have been floated out already.\nThese mention a 35 Nm peak torque, a top speed of over 100 kmph and a range of up to 250 km for the top variant. The electric bike will weigh 160 kgs and will be able to reach 0 to 60 kmph in less than four seconds as claimed by the company.\nAs for its variants, the electric bike will come in three options - Class, Grand and Elite spanning across range figures of 126 km to 250 km from the first to last. All of these will offer four riding modes, including a reverse mode.\nMohanraj Ramasamy (Representative Image)\nAlso read: Mahindra Reveals Six New Electric Car Lineup, Will Launch One Every Year From 2019\nInterestingly, Mohanraj also claimed that the Prana will come with “self-healing” capability. Judging from the earlier instances on electric vehicles, this would mean that the electric bike will be able to self-diagnose and correct minor issues by itself, mostly software related.\nThe roadmap\nAt the least, the company has ambitious plans for the vehicle. Designed and developed at the company’s Coimbatore campus, Srivaru Motors plans to produce up to 30,000 units of the Prana annually within the facility. It also decides to scale up the production to 2,00,000 units within 18 months, for which it will outsource the production.\nTo enable this, the company has been able to procure strategic investments by some serial entrepreneurs, as per a report by Autocar India. Once the units are produced, Srivaru Motors plans to sell them through 25 retail outlets mostly spread in South India.\nThe price of the electric sports bike has not been hinted at yet. Though the company does claim to launch it at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) in the 300cc segment. As and when it does, it will mark the start of a new segment in the Indian two-wheeler industry altogether, provided it is launched before the Ultraviolette EV, another electric sports bike in the making for the Indian market.\nIndiatimes®\nGet the NEWS that fits your groove.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-08'),

Just to be clear, \"structurally bankrupt\" is nothing more than a buzzword meant to drum up negative sentiment. A google search for the term turns up nothing other than negative Tesla articles. In order to determine if the sentiment around these buzzwords was accurate, I decided to break down Teslas financial documents.\nWhen analyzing Teslas financial statements, I wanted to see what progress was being made over the last year. To do this, I calculated various metrics based on the recently released 2019 Q2 10-Q and compared to the 2018 Q2 10-Q. What I found was that Tesla was making progress on a number of fronts toward becoming a stable and profitable company.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nSource: Tesla IR\nQuick Ratio: A quick ratio of 0.6 means that current liabilities are more than cash + cash equivalents, indicating that the company may have issues with meeting its short-term obligations. During the same period in 2018, the ratio stood at 0.37, meaning Tesla improved this metric over the last year.\nWorking Capital: Similar to the Quick Ratio, working capital indicates the readiness of a company to meet its short-term obligations. Tesla reported $593 million in working capital; in 2018, the company reported -$2.4 billion in working capital. Again, this was a positive step year over year.\nDebt-to-Equity: Tesla is highly leveraged with a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.3, meaning it relies strongly on debt to fund its operations. However, the company has actually reduced its leverage since 2018, when it reported a debt-to-equity ratio of 5.8.\nDays Sales Outstanding (DSO): A measure of how many days it takes to collect the funds in Accounts Receivable, Tesla reported DSO of 16.5; in 2018, the company reported DSO of 13. The increase in DSO is a negative for the company, as it means the company is taking longer to turn over accounts receivable. This may be a result of the company increasing overseas deliveries of the Model 3.\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO): A measure of how many days it takes to turn over inventory, Tesla reported DIO of 56.9; in 2018, the company reported DIO of 89.7. The reduction is a positive one, as it indicates that Tesla is selling finished inventory faster, possibly pointing to better delivery logistics.\nDays Payable Outstanding (DPO): A measure of how many days it takes to pay off Accounts Payable, Tesla reported DPO of 45; in 2018, the company reported DPO of 69. The decrease is a negative for Tesla, as it indicates that suppliers are requiring payment in a shorter time frame than last year.\nObservations: The companys balance sheet is healthier than it was 1 year ago, with assets increasing by $4 billion and liabilities increasing by $2 billion. Its liquidity has improved, while its overall leverage has decreased. However, the companys capital management suffered, as it is taking longer to collect accounts receivable and suppliers are demanding payment in less time. A sizable decrease in customer deposits indicates that new reservations are trailing orders being placed; this was to be expected, as Model 3 production is at an all-time high and the majority of the hardcore early adopters have received their cars, while new customers have a relatively short wait time before receiving their vehicle.\nIncome Statement\nSource: Tesla IR\nTotal Revenue: Tesla reported total revenues of $6.35 billion; in 2018, the company reported $4 billion in total revenues. The 59% revenue increase was actually more than the 43% increase reported in 2018.\nGross Margins: The company reported a total gross margin of 14.5%; in 2018, its gross margin was 15.5%. The 1% decrease is a step back for the company and is likely a result of falling average sales prices of its vehicles.\nOperating Margins: Tesla reported an operating margin of -2.6%, meaning the company spent more money on SG&A and R&D than it earned in gross profits. In 2018, the company reported an operating margin of -15.5%. The company is \"making it up on volume\", but it still has a ways to go.\nNet Margins: The company reported net margins of -6.4%; in 2018, it reported net margins of -17.9%. The large drop in negative net margin is another indicator that revenue growth is outpacing the increase in SG&A and R&D.\nObservations: Improving operating margin and net margin indicate that the company is becoming more efficient and is moving toward profitability. A decrease in gross margin should be the most worrisome part of the income statement for shareholders. As its manufacturing matures and becomes more efficient, it should be able to generate a higher gross margin, but if it wishes to reach profitability it needs to stop decreasing the price of its cars.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nSource: Tesla IR\nTesla was able to increase its cash position by $1.2 billion over the first half of the year, despite paying off $3.7 billion in debt. This was due largely to the $2.7 billion capital raise that was conducted in May, but the company also posted $224 million in cash flow from operations. The free cash flow is a result of the company selling more cars than it produced during the most recent quarter, as well as a reduction in Capex spending (59% reduction compared to 2018). A large part of the reduction likely stems from the fact that the Fremont Model 3 production line was completed over the course of last year. Its unknown to what extent the company drew down or cancelled other Capex projects to conserve cash.\nWith its largest ever cash position of $5.4 billion (and accounts receivable totaling another $1.1 billion), Tesla appears safe from any cash crunch in the short term. However, if it wishes to release the bevy of new products in the pipeline, Capex spending will need to be ramped up again. The company will likely need to raise capital again to continue its growth, as its operating cash flows likely will not meet its needs.\nConclusion\nTeslas financial documents point to progress being made on becoming profitable, but falling vehicle ASPs are proving to be substantial hurdles to overcome. The company managed to produce free cash flow, but only due to inventory liquidation and Capex reductions.\nWhile the company indeed has been unprofitable throughout its existence, this does not make it \"structurally bankrupt.\" Bankrupt companies dont deleverage their balance sheet or grow their cash balances. The financial statements indicate that increased scale, not a new business plan, is what is needed to achieve profitability.\nThis article was written by\n2.1K Followers\nFollow\nIm a Marine veteran, originally from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Tesla killed any rumor of potentially tapping into the motorcycle industry long ago—no Tesla bike on the horzion. That doesn’t mean that some of the people working in the Tesla offices don’t have ideas. After 20 years in California during which he worked for the famed Silicon Valley firm, engineer Mohanraj Ramaswamy has returned home to India where he plans to launch his own version of what an electric motorcycle should be.\nSo. Many. Startups.:\nA Dangerous Beauty: Newrons New Wooden Electric Motorcycle\nRamaswamy started his own company, Srivaru Motors that, like Zero and many, many other start ups, will focus on electric motorcycles, starting with the Prana. While Srivaru has yet to unveil a bike, a timeline showcased on the firm’s Website confirms that its first model is expected to go on sale this year.\nWhat’s so special about the Srivaru Prana? Should everything go according to plan, the model would become the first performance electric motorcycle produced in India. Or at least their definition of performance. While no electric horsepower figures have been announced, the company claims the bike will produce roughly 26 lb-ft of torque and run the 0 to 60 in under four seconds. Srivaru adds that the Prana should be able to reach a top speed of “over 60 miles per hour” and offer a range of “over 60 miles”—still pretty vague for a model apparently getting ready to hit the market in the upcoming months. An Elite variant of the Prana should boost the range up to 155 miles (that’s more like it!)\nWhile electric, the Srivaru Prana is expected to compete in the “small displacement” segment and measure up against the likes of the KTM 390 Duke and the Honda CB300R . The founder of Srivaru claims the motorcycle will feature “self correcting” components likely thanks to the onboard computer programmed with the ability to self-diagnose—something that remains to be confirmed.\nSrivaru expects to roll out 30,000 units within its first year of activity and reach sales of up to 200,000 bikes after 18 months. As for the price, it is expected to match the price tags found in the small displacements segment. All that is missing is, well, an actual, functioning bike.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-07'),

According to a story published in Autocar India, the start-up is floated by Mohanraj Ramaswamy, an engineer who had earlier worked in Elon Musks Tesla. Ramaswamy returned to India following a 20-year stint in California and now aims to launch his own Electric Vehicle (EV) business here.\nNamed Prana, the motorcycle is slated to be Indias first electric performance motorcycle. However, it faces competition from Ultraviolette EV, which could launch earlier. The Prana is expected to be equivalent of a conventional 300cc bike in terms of costs. According to Ramaswamy, the e-motorcycle will have some \"self-healing\" components and the Autocar report suggests these could be with the motor controllers and BMS system that could correct small issues after self-diagnosis. This, however, remains to be confirmed.\nThe Prana, which has already been registered, will come powered by an electric motor churning out 35 newton-meter of torque, which can propel the motorcycle from 0-60kph in less than 4 seconds. Furthermore, the bike will have a top speed of over 100kph and a real-world range of 126km from its fixed Li-ion battery, both figures claimed by the company.\nThe Autocar report further states that the Prana will have four riding models and will be offered in three variants including Class, Grand and Elite. The Elite will give a riding range as high as 250km and the Grand will come with a 126km range. Designed and developed at the companys control centre in Coimbatore, Srivaru Motors will initially produce up to 30,000 units annually at Coimbatore with an ambitious plan to outsource production and reach 2,00,000 units within 18 months of launch. While there is no word as to how much it will cost, it is expected that the company will add an aggressive price tag, with the company expecting to increase localisation level soon.\nfirst published:August 06, 2019, 12:53 IST\nlast updated:August 07, 2019, 13:32 IST\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-06');

(Credit: Jason Yang/YouTube)\nPosted on\nAugust 6, 2019\nThe Chinese government has stated that it is formally expanding Shanghai’s Free-Trade Zone (FTZ) to include the Lingang area, which hosts the site of Tesla’s Gigafactory 3. The update comes amidst a set of new tax incentives and import duty exemptions, which are being rolled out amid China’s continued trade tensions with the United States.\nThe plan to expand the FTZ was revealed by the State Council, China’s cabinet, in an announcement on Tuesday. The addition of the Lingang area, which is around the same size as the Hong Kong special administrative region, will roughly double the size of the Free Trade Zone .\nChina’s vice-commerce minister Wang Shouwen, who is among the country’s delegation in its trade talks with Washington, highlighted Beijing’s commitment to the expansion of the FTZ. “The expansion of the Shanghai FTZ is also an important step to demonstrate China’s clear stand for all-round opening up in the new era and its active role in guiding the healthy development of economic globalization,” Wang said.\nWith trade tensions with the United States hitting 13 months to date, Wang noted that Beijing would not hesitate to open its markets further, irrespective of developments in China’s trade ties with other countries. Speaking about these developments to the South China Morning Post , Shanghai vice-mayor Chen Yin noted that duties would also be deferred, or in some instances, not even collected, on certain products that are shipped through the new Lingang area.\n“Goods from abroad entering the fenced customs areas of the new area will be under bonded or tax exemptions,” Chen said.\n— Vincent (@vincent13031925) August 6, 2019\nThe formal addition of the Lingang area to Shanghai’s Free Trade Zone has been expected for some time, especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping stated last November that the FTZ would be expanded as a way for the country to deepen economic reforms and open up its market. Cao Hua, a partner at Unity Asset Management, a private equity firm, explained this in a statement.\n“It is a vast area that can accommodate mega-manufacturing projects, commercial complexes, and entertainment facilities. The announcement about its inclusion in the FTZ is not a surprise, but it boils down to whether land resources and financial capital will be used effectively to turn Lingang into a boomtown,” Cao noted.\nThe formal inclusion of the Lingang area bodes well for Tesla, whose electric car manufacturing facility is nearing completion. The progress of Gigafactory 3’s construction has been rapid, with local media reports stating that trial Model 3 production runs could begin as early as September , ramping to a manufacturing rate of 3,000 vehicles per week once operations are fully underway.\nChina formally adds Tesla Gigafactory 3 area to Shanghai’s Free-Trade Zone\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-06'),

The model also has an integrated rear spoiler and a curvaceous rear bumper with fake exhaust tips.\nMore notably, the i4 has an increased ride height that gives the car a bit of a Volvo S60 Cross Country vibe. We can also see what appears to be an aluminum support or bracket underneath the side skirts.\nWhile the exterior styling will be unique, previous spy photos have shown the cabin will largely carryover from the 3-Series.

In his tweet, Musk added the comment, “Ride the lightning!”\nThe photo was taken by photographer Richard Angle, who has a made a career out of taking pictures of rocket launches, but Musk didn’t mention Angle’s name in his tweet.

After all, why would Musk just be content merely working on the problems of Earth knowing full well that it would only take one extinction-level event to wipe it all out? If we manage to avoid all major asteroids, the Sun is still going to expand and burn us up in about 5 billion years, so we should probably practice living somewhere else in the meantime. Or so goes the argument. [For what it’s worth, I don’t need the existential argument to want to colonize other planets.]\nSpaceX and Musk have big plans to shuttle the first long-term residents of Mars to their new regolith-covered home. But in the meantime, Musk is also running an all-electric car company that’s expanding by the minute and keeps selling more and more cars. Tesla and SpaceX have already seen some relationship crossover, and two places particularly stand out: Musk’s cherry red Roadster sent into space by the maiden launch of Falcon Heavy, complete with Starman as its passenger; and the upcoming SpaceX thruster package that will be an option on the next generation Roadster.\nNow, imagine if that relationship were expanded to a colony-level scale on Mars…\n[[[[[ Camera fades to black then fades back in. ]]]]]\nThe year is 2050, and you’ve caught a seat on the last cargo ship bound for Mars full of red planet editions (rpe) of Models S, 3, X, and Y on their way for delivery to Colony Bravo. This is one of the last shipments to come from Earth before the Terafactory finishes construction and begins manufacturing on site. The company’s production lines were retooled to build the vehicles to work without air or air pressure and under extreme temperatures and high levels of UV radiation, along with a few other things to help traverse the planet’s surface better. However, skipping the satellite clean room procedures will be a welcome change for Tesla as it’s just one less thing their factory has to comply with to meet planetary protection regulations.\nYou’re on your way to visit your niece and nephew who were among the first humans to be born on Mars. Since the journey and stay on the planet will be long, you’ve taken up a contract job repairing Tesla tiles on habitation modules. That’s how you scored this economy class flight and can finally afford to see your brother for the first time since he and his wife left Earth for an Autopilot programming job at Tesla’s Gale Crater headquarters a few years ago.\nYour brother picks you up in his Roadster (rpe). He tells you a bit about the work he’s doing training Tesla’s neural net to map out the red planet as you drive along and take in the sights. The mapping has been very useful to the researchers on Mars for route and site planning. Licensing deals are now in the works with relocation companies to help the next wave of colonists pick out prime real estate. One of the groups is going to set up the first terraforming projects using some type of silicon aerogel.\nAfter arriving at your brother’s house, you finally meet your niece and nephew and the team of doctors monitoring their development. It seems a little invasive to have medical people in and out of their personal space so frequently, but your brother’s wife swears it’s become normal for them. You take note that the family’s habitat has both a top dome with Tesla tiles for electricity and an underground residence that’s connected to the larger city infrastructure via tunneled highways. A couple of them run on Hyper-T technology, Tesla’s Martian-modified version of the Earth-based Hyperloop, and the oldest tunnels were put in place by The Boring Company; however, several other digging and construction companies have since moved in, and Boring decided to just license its tech on Mars so it could focus on all the Earth projects it was busy with.\nYou get a quick tour of your brother’s local community and see that large facilities and shopping centers are also underground, but most garden pods are open to the surface with similar top domes to what your brother has, albeit much taller. You pass a battery storage center full of Tesla Megapacks (rpe) that are connected to solar panels at the surface.\nYour brother next takes you to the lodging facility that Tesla contracted for you. According to the area’s website, you’re staying in a modified Tesla Semi (rpe) that’s been converted into a type of RV. Since the big rigs were already climate controlled and pressurized for construction work throughout the planet, the retro fits were pretty cheap and give newcomers affordable housing while they settle into their new lives and contract one of the digging companies to bore out a residence.\nOn the way to your lodging, your brother sees a geologically interesting patch of regolith and wants to grab a few bits for his rock collection. Using the Roadster’s split-chamber function, an airlock is formed around the driver’s seat after a clear divider goes up between the two of you and seals into place. He zips his walkaround suit up to the atmospheric helmet stored under his seat and goes outside for a bit.\nAfter he comes back inside, he remembers that he didn’t offer to feed you lunch at his house and asks if you want to check out one of the local Supercharger stations where there’s a nice retro-themed restaurant. You don’t have to report to Tesla until tomorrow, so you’re up for it. Once there, you enter a car-sized airlock before moving into the charging area. Your brother mentions some things about how the Superchargers work there and how they need a pressurized environment like this one, prompting you to look upward. Somehow you missed the giant bubble encompassing the whole facility.\nYou both exit the Roadster and start heading towards Maye’s Diner a few hundred feet away. There’s an arcade in a building next door and before you ask about it, your brother tells you it was his favorite place to go when he first moved to Mars. It has all the old Teslatari classics, but the real draw is the virtual reality (VR) games from Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD) launch.\nYou remember the cool looking sunglasses that were sent to customers who’d purchased FSD that turned out to be VR headsets with games and experiences integrated with the Autopilot. Game obstacles were mapped from the actual roads as the cars were driving. Your brother reminds you that’s what inspired him to move to the red planet – the Total Recall VR experience that came pre-loaded in his Model S. The two of you then grab a bite to eat at Maye’s and head out.\nOnce at your RV habitat, you watch the local news streamed from your included Starlink-M Internet plan, and then notice you have mail already. It’s just marketing, but you read it anyway, kind of like you would read flyers for tourist attractions on vacation. The ad says Amazon Red has a new members deal for Earth classic deliveries. “A taste of home!” it says, along with explaining how the company makes deliveries to Mars every two weeks, regardless of orbital synchronization, and that all products are certified sterile by the Planetary Protection Food & Drug Agency. You wonder if the food items need to be reconstituted but then decide you’ve had enough information for one day and head to bed.\n[[[[[ Camera fades in and out again. ]]]]]\nSo, do you think Tesla will have a big presence on Mars once Musk et al. get there??\nTesla on Mars: A vision of an all-electric infrastructure on the Red Planet\n', 'TSLA', '2019-08-02'),

Unfortunately, public interest in the original story propelled it into the national spotlight.\nThe portion of the radio transmission focused on the officer in the Tesla patrol car, saying that he was running low on battery power, but the Fremont police say that the whole pursuit was being called off for safety reasons and it didn’t affect the pursuit:\nThe pursuit spanned approximately 10 miles and at times exceeded 110 mph. Regular updates regarding the speed, location, general traffic, and roadway conditions were provided by the second officer in the pursuit. Just before the pursuit ended at 11:13 p.m., the officer driving the Tesla responsibly notified his cover units he was going to have to back out of the pursuit because his battery was running low. Just after they passed the Montague Expressway exit, the suspect drove on the left shoulder of the road to pass a vehicle. At that time, the Fremont Police Sergeant monitoring the pursuit gave orders to terminate to ensure public safety. All three units deactivated their emergency equipment and returned to normal driving conditions. At that point, the Tesla was driven to a nearby charging station and the additional Fremont units returned to the City. CHP located the unoccupied vehicle in the area of I680 and the Berryessa exit. At no time did the battery of the Tesla become a factor in our ability to pursue the suspect or perform our duties. This situation, while embarrassing, is no different from cases where a patrol car runs low (or even dry) of fuel.\nAs we previously reported, Fremont’s police department bought a used 2014 Tesla Model S 85 to replace a 2007 Dodge Charger that was being retired in their fleet in order to test the electric vehicle to see if it’s viable as a police cruiser.\nAfter the negative coverage following the incident, Fremont Police now confirm that the vehicle has already been involved in two other pursuits where it “met and exceeded expectations:”\nOver the last six months, data on range, performance, equipment, and other elements has been gathered by officers through its use as a patrol vehicle. During this time we have documented two police pursuits, where the vehicle met and exceeded expectations. Our final results and data will ultimately help us determine if the EV technology meets current patrolling applications and cost effectiveness. We remain dedicated to our continued research into the benefits of using electric vehicles and the effects they have on our environment.\nCaptain Sean Washington even said that they are looking into now adding a Tesla Model X to their fleet:\nSo far, the vehicle is performing extremely well, and has exceeded our expectations. We are already in initial conversations about testing a second vehicle, likely an SUV model, and we look forward to providing our initial results in the near future.\nThe department emphasized that the range is not an issue at all. Their Model S outfitted for patrol gets about 220-240 miles per charge, and during an 11-hour patrol shift, Fremont patrol officers drive approximately 70-90 miles, according to the department.\nThey hope to share their initial data and feedback on the vehicle soon.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Incs TSLA.O board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musks multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company.\nFILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk attends the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China August 29, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\nTesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly.\nThe compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla’s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade.\nOn Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla’s request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package.\nAs a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla’s CEO. The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process.\nTornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors.\nThe ruling turned on Tesla’s compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight’s opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit.\n“Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk’s influence,” Slights wrote.\nMusk’s compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably.\nAt the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk’s award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives.\nUnder the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla’s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla to hit profitability metrics.\nMusk does not hold a majority of the Tesla’s stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk’s sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk.\nThe judge did dismiss Tornetta’s claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.\n(The story fixes spelling of Tesla in the headline)\nAdditional reporting by Alexandria Sage in San Francisco; Editing by Will Dunham\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-20'),

Arch Rao, CEO of Span.IO , thinks so.\nThe former head of Tesla’s energy storage business, Rao spent years integrating Powerwall batteries, rooftop solar inverters and other distributed energy resources (DERs) with the ubiquitous gray boxes that connect household circuits to incoming grid power.\n“It’s easy to recognize why the panel is a critical piece of infrastructure. It connects everything,” Rao said. “But that panel is still sort of antiquated. We’re re-architecting it from scratch to be a much more capable device — not to be just a passive current protection device, but more of a multiplexer, an [input/output, or I/O] for energy and data.”\nOn Thursday, the San Francisco startup unveiled its flagship product, the Span panel. From the outside, it resembles an oversized white glass-and-metal smartphone mounted on the wall. Inside are the power electronics, sensors, processing power and software to monitor and control up to 32 household circuits, plus solar or battery inverters, EV charger controls, and grid connect-disconnect, all via smartphone app.\nThis is light-years more functionality than today’s dumb electromechanical panels can provide, of course. But it’s also better than the solutions that DER integrators must today cobble together from disparate parts if they want to give homeowners more sophisticated ways to manage their solar and battery power alongside their household loads.\nThese are the customers Span is targeting for its initial rollout in California and Hawaii this year, working with “select market leaders” in the residential solar field. The first is Honolulu-based Revolusun, a leading solar-storage installer in Hawaii. \"Ive been waiting for a product like this for years,” Revolusun CEO Josh Powell said. \"It’s going to look better, perform better for homeowners, and simplify everything we do as installers both today and for retrofits down the line.”\nWhile Rao wouldn’t name other potential installer partners, it’s notable that Span’s executive staff includes a Tesla veteran, as well as Colin Law, Span’s head of partnerships, who formerly served as Sunrun’s director of energy services partnerships.\nLikewise, Span is working with solar inverter, battery and EV charger manufacturers to integrate their equipment with Span’s controls and application platforms. While Rao declined to name those manufacturers, the demonstration he offered at Span’s office included an LG Chem wall-mount battery.\nAs for the overriding question of how the high-tech panels will compete with their cheaper analog cousins, Span is targeting an upfront installation cost on par with the typical cost of a main panel upgrade required when solar, batteries or EV chargers are added to a home, or about $2,500, Rao said. With this, Spans installations are cost-advantaged even before the advanced functionality is taken into account.\n“The combination of the material cost reduction, but more importantly, the significant reduction in labor cost, is what allows us to get to cost parity. And that’s just cost parity on the hardware and installation,” he said.\n“When you include the software functionality we bring in, we’re way cheaper.”\nWhile Span plans to produce \"single-digit thousands\" of units for its deployment partners next year, that figure could grow to hundreds of thousands in the years to come, he said.\nThe electrical panel: Past, present, future\nRao left Tesla last year to found Span, and in December raised a “mid-single-digit millions” seed round from investors including Wireframe Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Energy Foundry, Ulu Ventures, Hardware Club, 1/0 Capital, and Wells Fargo Strategic Capital.\nAll the while, he and his partners were looking for patent filings and other intellectual property from others chasing the same high-tech electric panel concept. While there are many different versions of the idea for controlling commercial and industrial loads, on the residential side, “we haven’t found anything,” he said.\nThat might be because the electric panel is a commodity piece of equipment, made by a handful of electrical equipment giants like Eaton and Schneider Electric’s Square D. While these companies have experimented with “ smart circuit breakers ,” they have little incentive to challenge their distributor and contractor customers with a more expensive product.\nWhats more, the standard electrical panel does a fine job for most homes. But most homes adding DERs find their original panels need an upgrade, along with new equipment such as automated transfer switches and isolation transformers. Years at Tesla’s Powerwall business gave Rao an intimate understanding of the costs and complications of these upgrades.\nIt also gave him the insight that the electrical panel was the natural point for pre-integrating these technologies, rather than the inverters that have become the default central control nodes for most residential solar-storage systems to date, he said. The Span panel has integrated key solar inverter communications and control standards such as IEEE 1547 to ensure that it can disconnect during grid outages and serve other critical tasks.\nBut where Span’s panel really outpaces inverters is its ability to monitor, analyze and control each individual household circuit, he said. This includes sensors collecting voltage, current and frequency data at kilohertz resolution, as well as actuators that can disconnect and connect each circuit via homeowner command or automated presets.\nOutside of attaching current transformer clamps to every circuit, this level of data granularity is very hard to collect, he said. Energy disaggregation devices from startups like Sense can make do with induction clamps on a home’s electrical mains, but with a loss in accuracy and certainty of measurement, he said. But for the electrical panel, it’s a simple task.\nThis opens up a world of visibility and control that might otherwise be lost to solar-battery systems trying to manage household loads in relation to the home’s mix of grid-supplied and self-supplied electricity.\nTake the example of setting up a solar-battery system to back up critical loads during a grid outage. Today, this involves asking the homeowner to preselect and hard-wire critical loads to be powered by battery, with little control over their electricity consumption beyond turning them on and off.\nWith the Span panel and app, by contrast, homeowners can pick and choose individual circuits as “must-have” or “nice to have” loads during an outage, preset which ones shut down as battery life is depleted, or control them on the fly from their smartphones.\nAnd because the Span panel has been collecting circuit-level data for months or years before the blackout occurs, it can predict how much electricity those loads are likely to consume in the hours ahead, as well as directly monitor their current usage.\n“Nobody does that today — not even Tesla. We ended up falling back and saying, ‘We’ll just show remaining battery life,’” he said. But this kind of vague estimation will become less and less acceptable as DERs become a central part of more homes.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-19'),

In fact, the trend has been increasingly negative.\nBackground\nAs I had discussed in detail in \"Teslas Day Of VIE Reckoning Approaches,\" an article which Seeking Alpha published on Jan. 14, I identified a major obligation which Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has to its Variable Interest Entity (VIE) investors. This obligation seems to be commonly ignored. At the time, my bullet points were as follows:\nSolarCity regularly sold future cash flows to outside VIE investors in exchange for up-front cash. Tesla assumed these obligations in the 2016 acquisition and has taken on additional ones since.\nThese obligations now total over $1.3 billion, and are \"hiding in plain sight\" on Teslas balance sheet, but most analysts and the market seem to have not noticed them.\nThe asset sales have resulted in steadily increasing payments Tesla must make to these minority investors, mainly out of operating cash flow, which are now approaching $300 million per year.\nThese payments are not evident in quarterly shareholder letters - they are netted against new sales proceeds, generating significant positive cash flows to date. This is about to change.\nTeslas Q3 shareholder letter contained a subtle warning regarding the effect on Q4 results. Future impacts are likely to be more severe.\nCurrent Situation\nThe VIE obligation (\"Redeemable non-Controlling Interests\" plus \"Non-Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests\") currently stands at $1.435 billion. It has increased by about $100 million since Sept. 30, 2018, the last financial statements which were available when I wrote my previous article and by $45 million since Dec. 31, as the numbers below indicate.\nTesla creates these VIE structures by transferring solar or auto lease assets to a VIE, typically a partnership, and sells an interest in the partnership to outside investors. The partnership agreement usually assigns the associated tax credits to the outside investors, the value of which impacts the price the outside investors are willing to pay. These sales generate accounting income to SolarCity/Tesla and accounting losses to the outside investors because investors are willing to pay a premium over book value to obtain these \"off the books\" tax credits. The outside investors can then use the tax credits to offset their own income tax liability. This generates up-front cash and income for Tesla. Tesla generally has minimal tax liability and therefore cannot benefit from the credits directly.\nWhen SolarCity and then Tesla were originating large numbers of solar energy leases, the 30% tax credits were significant. In 2017, Tesla began selling leased cars into the VIEs and the accounting treatment for them was similar, with the outside investors paying for the benefit of the $7,500 tax credit at the time.\nHowever, the investors also get a portion of the ongoing income and cash flow from these assets, so the situation quickly reverses for each securitization, negatively impacting Teslas reported numbers. These full impacts are not obvious because the benefits to Tesla of new transactions are netted against payment obligations for old ones in the financial statements. However, the gross outgoing quarterly payments continue to grow and gradually chip away at the benefit from the new transactions. The result becomes dramatic when new transactions are minimal, as is the case for solar leases, now that very few of them are being originated and being transferred to VIEs. The impact can be seen in Teslas cash flow statement in its June 30 update letter:\nThe net cash flows from solar non-controlling interests went from positive $83.6 million in the first six months of 2018 to negative $53.7 million in the first six months of this year, a deterioration of $137.3 million. The second quarter of this year, at negative $40.6 million, was particularly poor.\nThe net cash flows from auto non-controlling interests also deteriorated, going from positive $56.9 million in the first half of last year to negative $14 million this year. The numbers fluctuate from quarter to quarter, presumably based upon the amount of new leased cars that are added to the collateral base, but the ultimate result is similar; eventually \"the piper needs to be paid.\"\nThe cash flows are presented a bit differently in Teslas 10-Qs. Instead of showing net cash flows, gross cash flows in each direction are shown although they are not segregated by type (auto vs. solar). Using that information, I was able to create the following table:\nIts significant to note that gross distributions paid in the first six months were $148.8 million. This number will likely grow, while the net proceeds are likely to shrink. This means the net cash outflow is likely to increase materially in the near future. Id also like to point out that in one of my January article bullet points, I wrote:\nThe asset sales have resulted in steadily increasing payments Tesla must make to these minority investors, mainly out of operating cash flow, which are now approaching $300 million per year.\nWell $148.8 million in six months definitely \"approaches $300 million per year.\" (That sound you hear is Bill patting himself on the back.)\nFinancial Presentation of Results\nOne fact that TSLA investors should understand is that its cash flow statements represent the consolidated results of Tesla and the VIEs. This is obvious if one compares the starting point on the cash flow statement above, which in Q2 showed a net loss of $389.3 million. The income statement actually shows that TSLA investors had a loss of more than $408 million per the statement reprinted below:\nThe significance of this is that the operating cash flow format includes the income and resulting cash flow owned by the VIE investors, not just TSLA. It also means that when the typical free cash flow calculation is performed, it overstates Teslas free cash flow.\nIt may be more useful to see Teslas free cash flow on an unconsolidated basis and then add whatever payments it may have received from the VIEs to calculate Teslas true free cash flow. Such a format would provide a clearer understanding of Teslas true financial condition. Of course, \"free cash flow\" is not really the whole story anyway. The definition of free cash flow is prior to debt borrowings/repayments as well as capital raises.\nAt the \"end of the day,\" the format of the financial presentations really doesnt make too much difference as long as investors understand the details. Unfortunately, very few seem to do so in the case of Tesla.\nThis lack of understanding was clear in a \"rebuttal\" which was written by another Seeking Alpha member shortly after publication of my earlier article. The author stated that because VIEs will only generate cash for Tesla once created and funded with assets, my article was incorrect and misleading. He further stated that because of this, contrary to my earlier articles conclusion, we would never see any negative impacts on the cash flow statements due to the VIEs.\nOf course, since my earlier article was written, we have in fact consistently seen these negative impacts. Although the author of the rebuttal article demonstrated a good understanding of VIEs overall, the analysis failed to understand the critical fact that Tesla starts with the combined cash flows of Tesla as well as the VIEs. Therefore, these subtractions represent the portion of the combined cash flows belonging to the outside VIE investors rather than representing payments going from Tesla to the VIEs.\nConclusion\nTeslas VIE obligations are large and poorly understood. The ongoing negative impacts on Teslas reported income and cash flow will be significant and will likely grow.\nThis article was written by\n2.08K Followers\nFollow\nI am a private investor and occasional mountain climber.

Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Panasonic), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.”\nLast month, it was reported that Tesla came to an agreement with LG Chem to supply Gigafactory 3 with cells made at their factory in Nanjing, which is about 200 miles (320 km) west of Shanghai.\nNow a different report from tech news publication ‘the Elec’ in Korea, where LG Chem is based, states that the battery manufacturer started to “mass produce batteries for Tesla’s Model 3 electric vehicles from its Nanjing plant in China” last week.\nAccording to the report, Tesla will now be getting NCM battery cells from LG:\n“LG Chem convinced Tesla to switch to NCM811 batteries based on the longer driving distances per charge. It also hinted that it may be able to begin mass producing NCMA batteries, which is even higher in nickel, beginning in 2022 to apply to EVs.”\nTesla consumes both NCA and NMC battery cells, but they only use the former for their electric vehicles and the latter for stationary energy storage products, like Powerwalls and Powerpacks.\nIf the new report is accurate, it would be the first time that Tesla uses NMC battery cells in its vehicles.\nElectrek’s Take\nIt’s not confirmed yet. I’d take the report with a grain of salt until we get a second confirmation.\nHowever, this is the second report that states that Tesla is working with LG Chem to supply battery cells to Gigafactory 3 and it is starting to sound accurate.\nI also don’t find it too surprising that Tesla would switch to NMC cells.\nWe recently reported on Tesla applying for a patent for a new longer-lasting battery cell with better performance and it is based on an NMC battery cell and they said it could be used both in stationary energy storage products and electric vehicles.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

But Neil had to bring up the supercar-fast Tesla Model S P100D and label it the EV champ that the Taycan is taking on.\nMaybe this seems perfectly natural, if all you know of the automotive realm is Tesla and Toyota.

But still, Tesla has been seriously manufacturing its own vehicles for about ten years. If you round up.\nFor comparison, cars such as the Ford Mustang (born in 1965) and the Chevy Corvette (born in 1953) have established Porsche-beating credibility in just their most recent iterations, when Ford and Chevy decided that they should be capable of challenging Europes best.\nThe car business isnt hard — its impossible\nElon Musk with the new Tesla Roadster.\nTesla\nAsk anybody in the car business if the business is hard and theyll look at you as if you had a second head. It isnt hard. Its impossible. The destiny of aspiring car makers, almost uniformly, is to fail. See Tucker. See Fisker. Even relative legends struggle: Aston Martin has gone bankrupt seven times.\nTesla hasnt just not gone bankrupt (despite being close in 2008) — its become Porsches biggest rival for the future of driving, at least according to some.\nI actually dont think Tesla and Porsche are rivals in any meaningful sense . But theres no avoiding the discourse. When the word \"Taycan\" is uttered these days, the world \"Tesla\" typically follows.\nRemarkable.\nGenerally speaking, its possible for niche players to steal mindshare from industry icons. Since 1992, Horacio Pagani has built his eponymous exotic nameplate into a brand thats talked about as a modern-day Ferrari or Lamborghini — and in the estimation of some pundits, builds more compelling cars. Likewise Swedens Koenigsegg, founded in 1994.\nBut those guys make bonkers supercars that sell in minuscule quantities and cost lots and lots of money. Tesla, meanwhile, isnt simply aiming to top vehicles such as the $100,000-plus Taycan with the $100,000-plus Model S trims; it also wants to take on Porsches parent, the VW Group, in the mass-market.\nIn that, success has been mixed. The relatively new Model 3 endured a fraught debut, but it did help the company to sell nearly 250,000 vehicles in 2018, a record. Tesla now dominates the EV market worldwide (dont get too excited — the worldwide EV market is tiny). Managing the situation is Tesla main concern. And that makes the reflexive Porsche comparos all the more remarkable. Because Porsche cares not one bit about the mass market. You settle for a Corolla. But you dream of a 911.\nOr perhaps a Taycan.\nThats Tesla. In 2009, a one-car company. In 2019, a worthy opponent for Porsche. Tesla has indeed come a long way, baby. And probably more than that.\nSign up for notifications from Insider! Stay up to date with what you want to know.\nSubscribe to push notifications\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-28'),

Tesla did not immediately comment.\nThe lawsuit reignites a dispute that has smoldered for years over how Tesla is allowed to sell cars in New Jersey. State law says new cars can only be sold through dealer franchisees. Manufacturers, like Ford, General Motors and Honda, are not allowed to sell cars directly to consumers.\nTesla doesnt have a dealer network and instead sells cars through its stores, which serve as showrooms where customers can meet with a sales person, see a Tesla and configure their own vehicle.\nThe state initially said Tesla couldnt sell cars directly to consumers . But in 2015, the state Legislature granted Tesla an exemption , limiting the car manufacturer to four sales locations. Tesla currently has stores in Springfield, Cherry Hill, Paramus and the Short Hills Mall.\nIt also has a fifth location at Garden State Plaza, the lawsuit states, calling it an \"unlawful retail location\" used to sell cars. A sixth sales location, this one in Lawrence Township, also is in the works, the lawsuit states.\nTesla has said the Garden State Plaza location is a \"gallery\" and not a store. But NJ CAR called it a \"flimsy basis to circumvent\" its limit of four stores.\nWhy should consumers care if a dealer or a manufacturer sells them a car?\nDealers are on the side of consumers when it comes to making sure warranty and recall work is completed, Appleton said.\n\"An automaker sees warranty and recall work as an expense, which they seek to avoid at every turn,\" he said. \"Auto dealers, under franchise laws, are paid by the manufacturer to fix their mistakes and so auto dealers see recall and warranty work as revenues and they seek to have the manufacturers live up to their obligations.\"\nIn mid 2018, the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission cited Tesla for operating a fifth sales location. But it later settled with Tesla after the car company said it does not conduct sales at the Garden State Plaza gallery.\n\"Those with the duty and authority to uniformly enforce our consumer protection and motor vehicle laws have sat on their hands allowing Tesla’s challenged business practices to go unabated,” said Angelo J.

She couldn’t provide details on why it wasn’t charged.\n“Hartman was monitoring the charge and responsibly notifying everyone of its status,” she said in a text Tuesday, noting the department had other officers as well as California Highway Patrol available to take over the pursuit if needed.\nThe CHP informed Fremont police that the car they were chasing was later found crashed into some bushes not far from where the chase was called off, and the driver was not found, Bosques said. The felony warrant associated with the car is from the Santa Clara Police Department.\nFremont’s police department made headlines earlier this year when this news organization broke the story that it would likely become the first police agency in the nation to roll out a Tesla as part of its patrol fleet.\nThe used 2014 Tesla Model S is considered part of a pilot program, to determine whether electric vehicles are suitable for police use on a larger scale.\nThe department spent a tad over $61,000 to buy the car from Tesla in 2018 — which has its main manufacturing factory in Fremont — and spent over a year modifying the car to get it ready for police use, officially rolling it out in March.\nThe used Tesla cost approximately $20,000 more than a new Ford Explorer police vehicle that the department uses for its other patrol vehicles, though officials said they expect to save on fuel and maintenance costs over the long run with the Tesla.\nThe department says it has been monitoring how the vehicle performs, and tracking metrics such as electricity costs versus fuel costs. Department leaders are expected to report their findings to the city council soon about how effective the car has been, and any potential shortfalls.\nFremont Police Capt. Sean Washington said in a July interview that things were going well with the Tesla pilot program, which had already been involved in at least one other pursuit at that time.\n“So far so good,” Washington said, noting there is usually about 40 to 50 percent battery life left after a normal shift. “We are easily able to make it through an 11-hour shift with battery power to spare.”\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-24'),

The couple wondered about the delivery delay, which they say wasn’t explained. Over the harsh winter, they drove the car minimally, mostly keeping it in their garage.\nThen, last April, they took the car to a detailer for a ceramic coating. The detailer found paint overspray and sand marks on the rear bumper and flaws on a rear quarter panel.\n“He called us up and said this car has been in an accident,” says Paul Nager, a cardiologist, whose mind immediately flashed back to the delivery delay.\nNager says a Tesla employee later confirmed it: “One guy said to us, ‘Yes, there was a little problem in Chicago.’”\nThe couple complained to Tesla, arguing they’d been tricked into thinking their new car was perfect — when it had been fixed and repainted without anyone telling them.\nThat was only the beginning of their troubles.\nThe Nagers demanded a new, undamaged car, which Tesla refused. Then ,Tesla said the Nagers couldn’t sue them because their purchase included an arbitration clause: binding contract language that bars consumers from accessing the civil legal system. They would have to argue their case before a private arbitrator, who would be paid by the company.\nIn court to escape arbitration\nThe Nagers are now suing Tesla in federal court in Kansas, arguing that they shouldn’t be forced into arbitration. They say they agreed to buy the car by dealing with a Tesla representative by phone and email and say they were never presented with a contract or arbitration agreement.\nA Tesla spokesman declined to comment on the case or about why the couple was sent a car that had been damaged and repaired.\nIn court, a lawyer representing Tesla argued that by logging into an online Tesla account, the Nagers essentially agreed to arbitration.\nBut Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Judge James P. O’Hara, ruling on a motion by Tesla to compel arbitration, ruled Sept. 3 that Tesla hadn’t proven that and that the court case could proceed.\nThe Nagers say they shouldn’t be bound by a contract they neither signed nor even saw —  on paper or online.\n“I never pushed a button because I didn’t have a button to push,” Debbie Nager says.\nThe fine print: You can’t sue\nThe Nagers’ experience highlights an increasing practice of arbitration clauses in everything from cellphone plans to employment contracts.\n“In many of these markets, you don’t really have any option that doesn’t include arbitration,” says Zachary Clopton, a Northwestern University law professor.\nBecause it’s not part of the judicial system’s public proceedings, arbitration isn’t public. There are several organizations that provide arbitrators who, for a fee, listen to both sides in a dispute and render a decision. Proceedings often happen in private conference rooms, with no public oversight.\nSince each matter is handled privately, it’s hard to assemble data or evaluate corporate behavior. So, if, say, a company handles a dozen separate claims of workplace harassment through secret arbitration proceedings, the pattern of harassment might never come to light.\nSupporters say arbitration is faster and less expensive than going to court and doesn’t burden the legal system.\nCritics say arbitrators who get repeat business from a corporation are more likely to rule against a consumer. A recent analysis of California arbitration cases by two professors at the University of California-Davis found that consumers prevailed 19 to 25 percent of the time when they went up against companies that repeatedly use arbitrators.\nArbitration clauses now ‘ubiquitous’\nThe Federal Arbitration Act was written in 1925, when arbitration was viewed as a way for businesses to quietly settle disputes outside the court system.\nStarting in the 1980s, binding arbitration clauses began creeping into other types of agreements, such as consumer purchases and employment contracts.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld forced-arbitration clauses, saying they supersede even state laws enacted to protect consumers.\nConsumers often are unaware they’ve signed away their rights — especially when “signing” a contract means clicking on an online purchase.\nIt’s often impossible for consumers to shop around for an alternative that doesn’t contain an arbitration clause, says Remington Gregg, counsel for civil justice and consumer rights for the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen.\n“They are ubiquitous,” Gregg says. “They are in every kind of contract that you can think of.”\nArbitration clauses vary but typically state the consumer or employee is agreeing to waive their rights to sue in court and instead must take all disputes before a private arbitrator. Often, the language is buried deep inside a contract or online agreement.\nAnd most people don’t realize that, by signing a contract with an arbitration clause, they are agreeing to a process with more narrow rules of evidence, no judge and jury and a limited ability to appeal.\n“A lot of people have no idea what that means,” Gregg says. “They just assume that it has all the hallmarks of the civil justice system.”\nLegislation would provide choice\nTo raise awareness, Public Citizen created a “Forced Arbitration Wall of Shame ” of companies that use arbitration clauses, including Amazon, Netflix, Starbucks, Uber, Airbnb, Wells Fargo and others.\nChange may be coming. The U.S. House of Representatives this month passed the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, which is being called the FAIR Act. It would prohibit forced arbitration in employment, consumer or civil rights claims and give consumers the opportunity — post-dispute — to decide whether they want to go before an arbitrator or a judge and jury.\nUntil there are more protections, Northwestern’s Clopton says state attorneys general should band together on consumer protection and workplace harassment cases to try to even the playing field for individuals who are boxed in by arbitration clauses.\n“I think consumers are getting more aware,” Clopton sahys. “But I still think there’s a wide gulf.”\nPaul Nager inspects the back of his new Tesla Model S, which he says was delivered with undisclosed damage that had been repaired.\nDave Kaup / Sun-Times\nThe Nagers say they still hope Tesla will make them whole — without having to go through arbitration or the courts.\n“I like Elon Musk,” says Paul Nager, who previously owned a Tesla and has recommended the brand to numerous friends. “I thought he’d never put up with this. If I just call the company … he’ll call me, and life’s gonna be great.”\nNow, he says, “I just don’t trust the company.”\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-27'),

The company posted the exclusive video to its YouTube channel last Wednesday (18 September 2019), but the footage has only found widespread circulation in the past 24 hours.\nIt’s apparent in the video that Tesla wanted to be as discreet as possible and quickly covered the red Tesla Model S to avoid further attention.\nHowever, in addition to the Tesla’s unmistakable sillouette, the other huge giveaway came via two crew members with “Tesla” emblazoned across their sweaters.\nAdding salt to the wound, the video shows a prototype example of the Porsche Taycan electric-car driving past the broken down Tesla over several laps while the Model S was being recovered.\nIt is unclear what caused the Tesla to break down but overseas reports claim the car will make another record attempt next month.\nA company representative reportedly boasted its prototype is capable of a 7 minute 5 second time – well under the 7 minute 23 seconds snapped on a handheld stopwatch by industry observers last week, and well under the Porsche Taycan’s time of 7 minutes and 42 seconds.\nLate last week, our spy photographers claimed at least one of the Tesla cars taking part in the record attempt had a stripped-out interior to save weight.

See our ethics statement.\nTesla unveiled the first V3 Supercharger at its Fremont, California factory just a few months ago, but the company is already making progress on the first concentrated buildout of the third generation of its fast-charging stations. That’s because 26 of the 46 charging stations currently being built along the transcontinental Trans-Canada Highway are V3 chargers, Tesla tells The Verge.\nThe new V3 chargers are capable of charging some Model 3s at rates of up to 250kW, making it possible to gain 75 miles of range in just five minutes. So far, the company has opened just a few other V3 Supercharging stations (including one in Las Vegas) beyond the original one at the Fremont plant.\nThe news comes as Tesla celebrates the seven-year anniversary of the first Supercharger stations this week. In the time since the company lit up those first fast chargers back in 2012 , Tesla has gone on to build out one of the biggest networks of EV chargers in the world, with 14,081 Superchargers across 1,604 stations in 36 countries.\nThe average Supercharger session puts about 35kWh worth of energy back into a customer’s battery pack\nTesla tells The Verge it’s seen more than 30 million charging sessions on its fast chargers since the first one was debuted in 2012. The company says its Supercharger network handles an average of 64,000 sessions per day, and doles out a total of about 2.25GWh of energy per day — meaning users take on about 35kWh of energy during an average charging session.\nDepending on the model, Tesla’s vehicles have battery capacities that range between 50kWh to 100kWh. While there’s an obvious psychological appeal to recharging your car to completely full (just like you’d refill a combustion engine car’s gas tank all the way), the numbers Tesla provided imply that a great deal of customers only charge up enough to get where they’re going. Whether that’s because they don’t want to wait for a full charge, or because they’re happy enough to just grab a few extra miles before heading home to finish filling the battery over night, is unclear.\nTo put some of these numbers in some context, ChargePoint — which controls one of the most widely distributed charging networks in the world — has more than 1,476 fast chargers around the world and 100,700 chargers in total, according to its most recent monthly fact sheet . The California-based charging company says it has powered more than 62,879,120 charging sessions in the 12 years since it was founded.\nBut since the overwhelming majority of ChargePoint’s chargers are of the slower Level 2 variety, the company’s network has delivered just 563,125MWh worth of energy over that time — the same amount Superchargers put out in about 250 days. Based on those numbers, the average charging session over ChargePoint’s existence is closer to 9kWh.\nOther comparisons are hard to make. When asked, EVgo was only able to share the number of charging stations on its network, and Volkswagen’s Electrify America said “we don’t provide usage data.”\nMusk once promised Superchargers would be solar-powered and fully off-grid\nTesla may have outpaced other charging networks across the last seven years, but like a number of the company’s efforts, the original vision was even more grand. In the 2012 blog post announcing the first Superchargers , Tesla promised the ability to drive “anywhere in the country on pure sunlight for free.”\nThe company also said it wanted to outfit Superchargers with solar panels from SolarCity (which at the time was still a few years away from being acquired by Tesla), with the goal of “generat[ing] more energy from the sun over the course of a year than is consumed by Tesla vehicles using the Supercharger,” resulting in “a slight net positive transfer of sunlight generated power back to the electricity grid.”\n“I think this day will actually go down as being quite historic, I think at least on par with SpaceX docking with the Space Station earlier this year,” CEO Elon Musk said at the 2012 unveiling .\nOf course, free Supercharging eventually went away, only reappearing from time to time as an incentive for new buyers . Only about six of the stations were hooked up to a solar panel setup in 2017 , and Tesla hasn’t shown off a fully off-grid Supercharger setup. There are a few more stations with solar panels, but it’s clear Tesla’s still a long way off from fulfilling the picture Musk painted back in 2012.\nStill, Tesla’s Superchargers tend to excel at the two things that matter most: reliable coverage and getting as much juice as possible in a short amount of time. Other charging networks (like Electrify America) are coming online, and that will certainly shift the balance in the years to come, especially since they tend to work with multiple makes and models. But by the time they’re built out, there will also be more electric cars on the road to charge. Maybe by then, stats like charging time and coverage maps will matter a little bit less than they do today.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-26'),

(Credit: Tesla)\nPosted on\nSeptember 23, 2019\nIndustry sources have suggested that LG Chem, a company reportedly tapped by Tesla as one of its battery suppliers for its Shanghai-based factory, has begun the mass production of 2170 cells for the Model 3 in its Nanjing factory.\nAccording to South Korean tech publication THEELEC , LG Chem is producing NCM 811 battery cells for the electric car maker, which features a nickel proportion of 80% or more. Prior to its reported contract with Tesla, LG Chem has used its NCM 811 cells for electric buses. The Model 3 will then be the first sedan that will use these specific, LG-made cells.\nThe industry sources claimed that LG Chem was able to convince Tesla to opt for its NCM 811 batteries under the premise that the cells will likely maximize the range of the Model 3. This is key to Tesla’s Model 3 production activities in Gigafactory 3 , as the site is intended to produce only the affordable versions of the electric sedan. If Tesla can reassure China’s EV market that its Made-in-China Model 3 has industry-leading range, the vehicle will likely receive a good amount of demand from the country’s mainstream car-buying public.\nWith Tesla as a customer for its Nanjing based plant, LG Chem has reportedly begun preparing its facilities to meet the electric car maker’s demand . LG Chem’s Nanjing plant is already operating at high levels, and earlier this year, the South Korean conglomerate announced that it will be investing 1.2 trillion won ($1 billion) to expand the facility’s production capabilities even more. But this is not all, as more expansion is expected as per Tesla’s request.\nInterestingly, the industry sources quoted by the South Korean tech publication mentioned that LG Chem is also looking to mass-produce NCMA batteries for electric vehicles starting in 2022. These upcoming cells will reportedly feature an even higher nickel content.\nReports of LG Chem’s partnership with Tesla initially emerged last August when Bloomberg revealed that the battery maker and the electric car company were in discussions for a potential working partnership. Provided that the recent reports from South Korea are accurate, the two companies’ collaboration appears to have been secured, and both companies appear to be working together to start Model 3 production in the Gigafactory 3 site.\nLG Chem’s Nanjing battery plant is strategically located. The facility is situated about 200 miles west of Shanghai, which would make transporting the cells to the Gigafactory 3 complex at the Lingang Industrial Zone a rather simple task. For one, the distance between the two China-based facilities is far shorter than the distance between Tesla’s Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, which produces 2170 cells for the Model 3, and the company’s Fremont factory, which assembles the vehicle.\nReports from China have suggested that Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 will not be exclusively supplied by LG Chem. Apart from the South Korean battery maker, Tesla is reportedly tapping into the services of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd (CATL) for a potential supply deal. So far, neither Tesla nor CATL have confirmed that a battery partnership has been established for Gigafactory 3’s operations.\nTesla battery supplier for China starts mass production of Model 3 batteries: sources\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-23'),

A Tesla camper, however, remains a thing of designer renderings, quirky DIY solutions and one-off special builds . Thats a shame because Tesla really is in the best position to make a fully electric RV with enough range, style and comfort to popularize zero-emissions camping, something were not expecting this beast to do. Maybe when Tesla starts rolling out semis and pickup trucks well see a proper e-RV. In the meantime, Dreamcase sells a fold-out bed that can turn a Model S, Model X or Model 3 into a basic mini-campervan.\nBased in Slovenia with fellow RV brands like Adria Mobil and Sipras , Dreamcase actually offers sleeping kits for a large variety of vehicles, from Jeep Cherokees to Porsche Panameras. The companys advertising makes it abundantly clear that Tesla vehicles were absolutely the driving force behind the design, though. And why not, Tesla already offers a \"camper\" mode , all it really needs is the actual camper.\nThe Dreamcase wears a Tesla-like font and car-matching color\nDreamcase\nThe Dreamcase isnt quite a Sipras-style all-in-one camper box, but it does take care of the most important part of the camper equation, packing a foam mattress, duvet and pillows into a sleek, functional carry case. The folding mattress features four panels, expanding out into a bed within a couple minutes. The case itself folds out into a sleeping platform, raising the height of the trunk to match the folded rear seats for a more level night of sleep. At just 37 to 39 in (94 to 99 cm) wide, the Dreamcase is really a twin-size mattress, probably better for a single person than two. We suppose a couple or mother and child could make it work, but it certainly looks extra cozy. The 76-in (193-cm) length, on the other hand, is enough to accommodate the average male or female comfortably.\nThe Dreamcase mattress can also fold into other positions, working as a makeshift lounge chair. The individual panels can also split apart and serve as outdoor seating cushions.\nEnjoying the view from a Dreamcase camper\nDreamcase\nWhile the Dreamcase doesnt include any other camper equipment, like stove, shower or toilet, its the perfect complement for Teslas Party & Camper mode, showing the advantages that all-electric camping can offer. As you may recall, that mode is designed to allow those hanging out inside a parked Tesla to keep the climate control, air circulation, audio and select lights running, essentially using the high-capacity lithium battery like the secondary leisure battery youd find in a motorhome or trailer. So not only do you have a mattress to sleep on but also a climate-controlled cell with available music and lighting – not bad for a barebones camper.\nThe Tesla Dreamcases start between US$709 and $779 (before duties or taxes), available for the Model 3, five-seat Model S, and five- and seven-seat fold-flat Model X. The base kit includes the case, mattress, pillows and duvet. Other compatible vehicle models include the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Jaguar I-Pace, Mercedes-Benz EQC, Volkswagen Atlas, and Volvo V90 and V60 Cross Country wagons.\nA nice night to car camp\nDreamcase\nThe design is nice enough, but for $700+, wed be inclined to settle for a home build of sub-$100 tri-fold or inflatable mattress and simple leveling solution, enjoying the same Tesla camper-mode overnighting features for a lot less money. But we suppose style and design matter more than a little money to many a Tesla buyer, and the Dreamcase is certainly a fancier, all-inclusive option for those looking to jump in on car camping and overnight travel. Plus, sleep in your Tesla for a few nights instead of a hotel and the Dreamcase can pay for itself.\nDreamcase got the Model S kits to market in 2017 and followed up with the Model X and 3 kits last year. Its compiled quite a selection of YouTube videos of Tesla campers in action.

Tesla, for one, has  added an exterior speaker system to its EVs, which was caught in action on a pair of Model 3s recently.\nadvertisement scroll to continue\nAlso Read: We’re Spending Four Days With A Tesla Model 3 Performance – What Do You Want To Know?\nThe first video comes courtesy of Zach Feldstein and sees the noisemaker in action on his neighbor’s Deep Blue Metallic Model 3, which according to Teslarati was emitting the “Reverse” version of the noise meant to tell pedestrians there’s a car coming – or, in this case, backing up.

The technician also said that every Model 3 built after September 1st would feature this technology, which is capable of emitting two different sounds, one for low-speed forward driving and one for reverse.\nThere’s also a second video, courtesy of Tesla owner David, who caught a white Model 3 backing up slowly and sounding like something from The Jetsons. For some reason this doesn’t sound as wacky as the blue one, but that’s probably due to the proximity to the car’s speaker.\nCame across a Model 3 today at an EV car show in Bloomington IL that had the in-motion low speed warning sound.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nBefore Rivian has even begun commercial production at its factory in Normal, Illinois, the Amazon order rocketed it to the forefront of electric vehicle makers.\nAmazon AMZN.O Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in Washington that as part of the online retailers plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 it would order the electric vans from Rivian, with deliveries starting in 2021. The goal is to deploy all the vehicles by 2024.\nRivian, a potential rival to Silicon Valleys Tesla Inc TSLA.O , unveiled its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV last November, but had piqued Amazons interest earlier. Bezos personally reached out to Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe last summer to express interest in an investment, sources previously said.\nPlymouth, Michigan-based Rivian, founded in 2009, has raised close to $1.9 billion from investors, including a $700 million February round led by Amazon.\nThe deal solidifies Rivian’s place among EV builders, said Sam Fiorani, a vice president with Auto Forecast Solutions. “It helps boost the image of the (Rivian) brand,” he said.\nRivian aspires to be the first to produce a mass market electric pickup. It intends to begin selling its R1T by the end of 2020, a target that has not changed with the Amazon deal in place, said Rivian spokeswoman Amy Mast said.\nTraditional U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co F.N , a Rivian investor, and General Motors Co GM.N , as well as Tesla, are pushing to develop their own electric pickups.\nThe Amazon vans, under the exclusive deal, will be built at Rivian’s plant, a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, Mast said. The first vehicles will be delivered in 2021 and 10,000 should be on the road by late 2022, she said. The vehicles will be serviced by Rivian.\nScaringe has described the Rivian vehicle’s platform as a skateboard that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.\nAmazon is looking to speed packages to shoppers doorsteps regardless of spikes in consumer demand or shortages of delivery personnel. Last year, Daimler AGs DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz said Amazon had become the biggest customer of its Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors.\nFord invested $500 million in Rivian in April with plans to use the Rivian EV platform to build a new vehicle in North America. Details of that vehicle were not disclosed. Ford is not involved in the Rivian deal, Mast said.\nCox Automotive Inc, the owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and the Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, invested $350 million in Rivian this month. The companies will explore partnerships in digital retailing, service operations and logistics.\nOther backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co, Sumitomo Corp of Americas and Standard Chartered Bank.\nAmazon’s reputation and the contract size would raise Rivian’s status with potential customers and investors, Fiorani said.

If you want to turn your Tesla into a donut-making machine, you might want to take notice.\nAs the YouTuber explains at the end of the video, the process is quite simple; all you need to do is have the vehicle turned on, switch it into ‘Drive’ and then put in back in ‘Park’. Next, you must open the Settings menu and press ‘Service.’ When this menu loads up, you change the wheel configuration to anything other than the wheel/tire package the vehicle currently features.\nadvertisement scroll to continue\nFollowing these steps will trigger the car to reset itself and, as this is happening, you re-enable drive, and that’s it – all the safety systems have been disabled.\nAlso Read: Angrier Tesla Model S P100D Spotted On The ‘Ring, Complete With Wide Fenders, Fat Tires And A Cage\nThe result is a driving experience totally foreign to most Tesla owners. As Brooks notes, driving one without any form of regenerative braking is very bizarre. In terms of performance, disabling the safety systems means drivers cannot enable the launch control system to achieve maximum acceleration, but you can still pin your throttle to the floor and record a 0-60 mph (96 km/h) time of about 2.6 seconds despite the car’s wheels spinning up a little bit.\nThen come the donuts. The tested produces an extraordinary amount of horsepower and torque and spins up all four wheels with incredible ease if the traction and stability control systems are put to sleep.\nWe guess Tesla will likely patch the bug with a future software update, so anyone interested in trying this out should do it out before it’s gone forever – but always bear in mind that, without the safety net provided by the electronics, they must definitely have their wits about them if they don’t want the whole shenanigan to end up in tears.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-19'),

Some owners have noticed a data use counter showing up on their cars with a seeming 50GB cap.  Its not yet clear what this cap is for or what happens if you chew up more than 50GB of data.  However, Tesla is displaying this to people with the Premium Connectivity package, not just Standard.\nWeve asked Tesla for comment.  It may have more to say about data usage once theres a wider rollout for its cars version 10 firmware.  Having said that, it wouldnt be surprising if Tesla charged extra for heavy data use. Netflix and YouTube streaming are on the way, and those can easily consume gigabytes of data in a single session.  Caps could discourage drivers from going on Stranger Things marathons in their cars and help Tesla stay on the good side of carrier partners anxious about their network loads.\nView All Comments\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-25'),

(Credit: Tesla Raj/YouTube)\nPosted on\nSeptember 20, 2019\nTesla’s V10 update is filled with new features, and a number of them are designed to enhance a car’s fun factor. From Netflix and YouTube streaming through Tesla Theater to a cool new run and gun game in the form of Cuphead, the electric car maker appears to be making a serious push towards making its vehicles as enjoyable as possible.\nPerhaps one of V10’s features that will likely be a bonafide boredom killer is Caraoke, which, as the name suggests, turns a Tesla into a giant karaoke machine when it’s on Park. Teslarati‘s own Arash Malek and owner-enthusiast Tesla Raj checked out this new feature (among others), to get a pretty in-depth look at some of its cool functions.\nTrue to its namesake, Caraoke allows a car’s occupants to sing along to a curated list of tracks whose lyrics are displayed on the screen, provided that a vehicle is on Park. Footage taken of the feature in action reveals that Caraoke allows songs to play either as a minus one track, or with full lyrics on.\nCaraoke also features several cool categories, from Disney tunes (a sure hit for kids or kids-at-heart), and Duets, a list of songs that are intended to be sung by two people. Several charts are available, which arranges tracks according to genre, decade, or language, among others.\nA look at the feature in action reveals that Tesla’s Caraoke is powered by Stingray Karaoke , a web-based service that was borne from the acquisition of Soundchoice by Stingray Digital. Stingray Karaoke’s official website notes that it currently has over 10,000 tracks, with new ones being added every week.\nWith Caraoke and V10’s other fun features loaded on vehicles, it will be pretty difficult to have a boring drive in a Tesla. This is especially true for Supercharging sessions, which are only bound to get shorter with the rollout of the company’s V3 chargers. V3 chargers are capable of charging a Model 3 at 250 kW or 1,000 miles per hour , which translates to charging sessions that are only around 15 minutes long. That’s just worth 3-4 Caraoke tracks, short run on Cuphead, or half an episode of a TV series on Netflix.\nWhen Elon Musk was featured in the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, he remarked that Teslas are arguably the most fun things people can buy. Musk stated that he believes Teslas are more than just cars; instead, they are machines that maximize enjoyment . “I think a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly ever buy. It’s not a car, it’s a thing to maximize enjoyment,” he said.\nAs our very own Arash Malek and Tesla Raj figured, this is indeed the case.\nFirst look at Tesla’s Caraoke in action\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-20'),

Last June, employer branding specialist Universum released the results of its study on the US’ most attractive employers, and it revealed that SpaceX and Tesla, Elon Musk’s two companies, were considered by engineering students as the best companies to work for today.\nWith the traditional auto industry and the tech segment both pushing efforts to achieve full self-driving solutions, Tesla is bound to compete with rivals in acquiring talented software engineers to develop and refine its autonomous technologies. Veteran automaker GM, for example, has announced its intention to invest in autonomous vehicle technologies, as headlined by the progress of its self-driving division, Cruise.\nAccording to tech career information firm Dice Insights , Tesla does hold an advantage over traditional automakers such as GM in terms of its ability to attract the best software engineering talents available on the market. Part of this is due to Tesla’s willingness to pay its software engineers with higher salaries compared to GM.\n(Photo: Andres GE )\nData from salary tracking service levels.fyi indicates that Tesla pays its Senior Engineers about $220,000 per year, while a Software Engineer 3 (a comparable position) in GM receives around $137,000 annually. An Associate Engineer at Tesla also reportedly receives around $98,000 per year, around $23,000 more than a GM’s Software Engineer 1, who receives just below $75,000. In comparison, pure tech companies provide more pay, with Google offering an average annual salary of $115,000 for entry-level engineers, and Facebook providing an average of $111,000 per year.\nGranted, Tesla’s engineers reside in California, which has a far higher cost of living compared to GM’s software engineers in Detroit. That being said, the fact that Tesla’s software engineers are offered a compensation package that is more in line with a tech company than an automaker like GM appears to benefit the electric car maker. Connected vehicles live and die with software, after all, and a significant number of the US’ best software engineers are in Silicon Valey. This set up, if any, makes it difficult for companies such as GM or Ford (whose entry-level software engineers earn just below $73,000 per year as per payscale.com ), to attract the best talent for software available.\nAdd this to the fact that companies such as Tesla embrace innovation far more than traditional carmakers such as GM, and the electric car maker ends up becoming an ideal workplace for engineers who are hungry to explore their limits . This is something that was previously mentioned by legendary businessman and longtime Shark Tank Judge Kevin O’Leary, who related one of his recent observations after watching Formula E races.\nTesla Gigafactory 1, where Model 3 battery cells are produced. (Photo: Tesla)\n“Colleges and universities around the world with an engineering department generally puts forward an electric Formula 1 car and engineering teams in their graduating years race these cars all over the world. I’ve been hanging out at the pits with these engineers, and I’ve learned something extraordinary. When you go to one of these races… when the race is over, the winning team — they come from anywhere on Earth — who do they want to talk to?\n“They want to talk to the Tesla hiring team there; the HR people hanging around at the pits. Every one of these engineers, the smoking hot kids that sit with their cars, the men and women that sleep with them for 24 hours a day; it’s an unusual culture I’ve never seen before. They all want to work at Tesla. Why? Because the teams are six to eight people. If they go to a legacy car company, they get drowned out in the back somewhere. These smart, young, men and women make a big difference as interns. I can’t believe the access to talent they have,” he said.\nIt is now becoming evident that the next generation of automobiles will be fought with electric vehicles that are heavily based on software . Veteran carmakers are now seeing this, and they are starting to prepare their own vehicles for this new era. Porsche has the Taycan, and Volvo’s Polestar 2 fully embraces Google’s ecosystem. Amidst all these efforts from experienced auto, Tesla is pretty much turning into the EV equivalent of Apple during the first years of the touchscreen-based smartphone era — less experienced but far more determined and innovative.\nTesla’s ability to attract top software engineering talent explained\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-19'),

You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\nWatch on\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted its latest round of crash tests this summer, examining the crash performance of a number of electric vehicles. This latest batch of testing was significant because there is now a large enough variety of electric cars on the market, and its important to examine how their different structural parameters affect crash test performance. Even though they are still being compared to a common scale when it comes to internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles, were now in an era where some conclusions can be drawn about the specifics of EVs in crashes, especially as it concerns passenger safety and batteries.\nTo earn a Top Safety Pick award, a car must receive a Good rating in the driver-side small overlap front, moderate overlap front, side, head restraint and roof strength tests -- all of these elements together -- in addition to an Acceptable or Good rating when it comes to the passenger-side small overlap tests. The IIHS introduced the\ndriver-side small overlap and moderate front overlap tests just a few years ago, to mimic the glancing impacts of real world crashes when just a fraction of the front side of a vehicle hits another vehicle or a stationary object. This battery of tests is viewed as a more realistic recreation of real-world impacts, because not every real-world crash involves 100 percent of the front of one vehicle hitting another vehicle or an object. A number of automakers have had trouble with crash test performance in front small overlap scenarios , having been building vehicles for years aimed to perform well in crashes where most of the front of their vehicle hits a stationary object or another vehicle. In real-world crashes, thats not always the case, and the IIHS has begun replicating these impacts.\nTo earn a Top Safety Pick + rating -- the top tier award -- a vehicle must obtain a Good rating in the passenger-side small overlap test as well as in the headlight evaluation. The IIHS has started taking a closer look at headlight performance, which is an area that has at times not been given enough attention by automakers. Recently, a number of popular vehicles were faulted for less than ideal headlight designs and performance.\nHow did this latest batch of EVs do in IIHS crash tests?\nRelated Story\nHeres what a zero-star pickup crash test looks like\nThe Tesla Model 3 grabbed good ratings across the board for crashworthiness, qualifying for Top Safety Pick + with its standard crash prevention system rating -- another item the IIHS has begun to test -- earning a superior rating as a result of being able to avoid collisions in 12 mph and 25 mph IIHS track tests. The headlights also earned a Good rating.\n\"The Model 3s structure held up well in one of the Institutes most challenging crash tests, the driver-side small overlap front test,\" the IIHS added. \"Intrusion of 8 inches at the lower door-hinge pillar contributed to a moderate risk of injury to the drivers lower leg, as indicated by measures taken from the dummy. No other injury risk was recorded, and the front and side airbags and the seat belt worked well to control the dummys movement during the crash.\"\nThe Chevrolet Bolt earned Good ratings in all tests except for the except for the passenger-side small overlap test -- it only earned an Acceptable rating in that test because the passenger dummys movement was less than ideal, according to the IIHS.\n\"After hitting the frontal airbag during the test, the dummys head moved toward the gap between the frontal and side airbags, leaving it vulnerable to contact with hard parts of the vehicle interior,\" the IIHS indicated.\nRelated Story\nAutopsy reveals NASCAR crew chief died of cocaine, oxycodone and alcohol combo\nThe institute noted that the Acceptable passenger-side rating would have been suitable for it to earn a Top Safety Pick award when optioned with the front crash safety prevention system, which is not a standard item on the car, but the Bolts headlight performance earned a poor rating because they produce excessive glare to oncoming traffic.\nThe Tesla Model 3 wasnt the only non-ICE vehicle to earn a Top Safety Pick + ratings this year -- the Audi e-tron did the same with items that are standard on the car, as opposed to optional.\nAnother non-ICE vehicle also picked up a Top Safety Pick + award, but it wasnt an electric one. The hydrogen fuel-cell-powered Hyundai Nexo earned the Top Safety Pick + with standard equipment. If you havent seen a Nexo around, thats because its on sale only in niche markets.\n\"Vehicles with alternative powertrains have come into their own,\" IIHS chief research officer David Zuby concluded. \"Theres no need to trade away safety for a lower carbon footprint when choosing a vehicle.\"\nRelated Story\nJay Ramey\nJay Ramey grew up around very strange European cars, and instead of seeking out something reliable and comfortable for his own personal use he has been drawn to the more adventurous side of the dependability spectrum. Despite being followed around by French cars for the past decade, he has somehow been able to avoid Citroën ownership, judging them too commonplace, and is currently looking at cars from the former Czechoslovakia.

(Photo: Arash Malek)\nPosted on\nSeptember 22, 2019\nFollowing its visit to Pixar HQ for the esteemed animation studio’s green day celebration for employees, the Tesla Semi headed to the headquarters of another reservation holder: veteran transportation, logistics, and warehousing company Yandell Truckaway, which as been in the trucking business since 1945. Yandell had ordered 10 units of the Semi’s 300-mile version for its fleet, as part of its efforts to fully embrace sustainable solutions.\nYandell aims to utilize its Tesla all-electric trucks for its asset-based trucking division, with the vehicles operating in Northern California and catering to the area’s temperature controlled wine transportation and storage industry. This makes the Semi’s 300-mile variant perfect for Yandell’s business, as the trucks would likely have enough range to perform their day-to-day tasks and simply charge at night. In a statement, Yandell Truckaway COO John Yandell III remarked that the Semi is a perfect match for the company’s history of embracing bleeding edge technologies.\nThe Tesla Semi visits Yandell Truckaway.

Throughout that time we have prided ourselves by staying at the forefront of technology, making our operations more efficient and environmentally friendly. With the introduction of the Tesla Semi truck, we are looking forward to ushering in the most substantial and groundbreaking piece of technology the trucking industry has ever seen,” the COO said.\nThe executive made it clear that the 10 Tesla Semis Yandell Truckaway ordered are intended to replace the trucks that the company is currently using. Eventually, Yandell plans to transition its fleet into zero-emissions trucks. With this in mind, the trucking veteran is laying the groundwork to prepare for the deployment of its Tesla Semi fleet, as well as its succeeding sustainable initiatives. A huge part of this will be the company’s charging infrastructure, which will likely be a key factor in determining whether or not its EV trucking push will succeed.\nThe Tesla Semi visits Yandell Truckaway.

Other electric trucks that the company plans to use, as well as electric-powered forklifts for its warehousing operations, will be charged using this upcoming building as well.\nThe Tesla Semi holds the potential to disrupt the lucrative trucking market. To allow the vehicle to be competitive, Tesla designed its truck to capitalize on the strengths of EVs as much as possible. The Semi is equipped with four Model 3-derived electric motors , which allow the long-hauler to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5 seconds flat while bobtailing. With a full load, the Semi is capable of hitting highway speed in around 20 seconds, far quicker than diesel-powered trucks. The Semi will also feature a unique “Convoy Mode,” which would allow multiple trucks to semi-autonomously draft close to each other.\nThe Tesla Semi was initially announced for production in 2019, though this date has been adjusted for 2020 . The company has hinted at improvements in the Semi since its unveiling, with Elon Musk teasing that the production long-range variant of the truck will have closer to 600 miles of range per charge.\nWatch some sleek drone footage of the Tesla Semi in its visit to Yandell Truckaway in the video below.\nTesla Semi to kick off Yandell Truckaway’s transition to an all-electric fleet\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-22'),

The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 14, 2019\nThe automaker is still pushing hard to deliver more vehicles by the end of the quarter, but we don’t know the exact target.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-20'),

Through two separate tests, one that would simulate both highway and city driving and another that involves highway speeds, Nyland was able to provide figures for the vehicle’s real-world energy consumption. Both tests were performed on the same stretch of highway that spanned around 46 km (28.5 miles) one way. Nyland would travel the 46 km and then turn around, making the total distance per test around 93.3 km (57.97 miles).\nThe first test required the vehicle to travel at 90 km/h, or 56 mph, a speed that Nyland stated would best simulate both city and highway driving. It was performed after a short charge that only had the function of resetting the dash’s “since last charge” measurement. The hour-long trip showed that the Model X Long Range used 16.5 kWh of energy and 177 Wh/km. If the SUV were to travel at this speed for an entire charge, the vehicle’s 100 kWh battery pack would likely last around 565 km, or 351 miles, on a single charge.\nThe “Raven” Tesla Model X Long Range’s statistics after Nyland’s first test (Credit: YouTube/Bjørn Nyland)\nAfter running the first assessment with the Model X, comparisons were made between other manufacturer’s electric cars. The closest to the Model X Raven in terms of energy efficiency was the Mercedes EQC , a vehicle equipped with an 80 kWh battery pack that used 192 Wh/km in the same route. These figures are estimated to give around 417 km, or 258 miles, of range.\nThe next test involved be a more realistic highway assessment, with Nyland traveling the same distance course at 120 km/h, or 75 mph. This 48-minute test used 21.3 kWh of energy and 229 Wh/km. These numbers would give the car 402 km, or 250 miles of range, outperforming its closest competitor in the test, the Jaguar I-Pace by a considerable margin. Nyland’s previous tests on the I-PACE showed that compared to tge “Raven” Model X, the Jaguar crossover SUV would only give about three-quarters of the range and use 15% more energy.\nThe “Raven” Tesla Model X Long Range’s statistics after Nyland’s second test (Credit: YouTube/Bjørn Nyland)\nThe “Raven” Model X Long Range’s efficiency results speaks once more to Tesla’s lead in the range and efficiency segment for electric vehicles. Despite the Model X being in the market for around four years now, rivals from veteran manufacturers such as Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz appear to be having problems catching up to the large, spacious vehicle’s range and efficiency. This is particularly evident in the Audi e-tron, an SUV with a 95 kWh battery pack that is pretty much gaining a reputation for being the electric equivalent of a gas guzzler.\nBjorn Nyland is among the EV community’s most experienced members. Having embraced EVs for years, Nyland has tested numerous electric and electrified vehicles, from Teslas to BMWs and Jaguars. Nyland owns a Model X, fondly named “Optimus Prime,” which was won through a Tesla referral program. He has also won other cars through referrals, including a Model S and the Next-Gen Roadster .\nWatch Bjørn Nyland’s Model X Long Range Raven energy efficiency tests in the video below.\nTesla Model X Raven subjected to EV veteran’s real-world efficiency test\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-25'),

But organizing efforts failed anyway, due in part to staunch political opposition in a so-called \"right-to-work\" state. (Japanese and German automakers have established numerous factories in the US South, and none of them are unionized.)\nThe unions abject failure at Tesla\nTeslas factory in California.\nTesla\nTesla is a different story. It took over an old GM-Toyota plant in the Bay Area — a plant that had been unionized prior to GMs 2009 bankruptcy. California is decidedly not a right-to-work state, and for years, there have been rumors that an organizing effort is underway at Tesla. Management, including CEO Elon Musk, hasnt strongly opposed collective bargaining, but they havent endorsed it either.\nPerplexingly, however, union efforts at both plants have either failed (VW) or failed to launch (Tesla). Neither campaign had the kind of bare-knuckled (not literally) quality of an unsuccessful bid to organize a Nissan plant in Mississippi in 2017. In VWs case, there were two votes to unionize, separated by five years (2014 and more recently in June); the UAW lost by a slight margin in 2019, just 57 votes in a potential bargaining unit of about 1,600 workers.\nIn the South, the anti-union script usually involves the nonsensical threat that the big car maker will close its factory and move production elsewhere, immediately killing the jobs.\nVolkswagen and Nissan operate unionized plants everywhere but the US South, so the threat is meaningless at that level. But these companies have also spent billions to set up production in one of the worlds most lucrative auto markets and have been investing in something called \"backfill\" — choosing the South not just because of its tolerance for lower wages but also due to its appealing demographics. There are enough future workers in Tennessee and Mississippi to keep factories staffed.\nTeslas somewhat indifferent counterarguments maintain that its workers, in Silicon Valley style, have equity in the company and dont need a union to improve their deal. But Tesla also has the only car factory in California, and certainly in the Bay Area. With approximately 10,000 workers building cars — thats a lot, by the standards of modern automaking — the company can also quietly note that it has the best deal in town for folks who lack advanced degrees.\nNeither argument should prevent the workforce from organizing a bargaining unit, however. Ive always thought that Tesla should simply look completely the other way and accept that what was a UAW shop before should logically be once again. The UAW should be able to coast into adding a significant number of members.\nBut, pointedly, it hasnt. Worse, the organizing effort at Tesla seems to be going exactly nowhere. If youre looking for the biggest miss by organized labor in the 21st century, this is Exhibit A.\nSo what does this all have to do with the GM strike, which has now lasted a week?\nGM gave away the farm — and the UAW went on strike, anyway\nGM CEO Mary Barra and President Trump.\nGetty Images\nOn its face, the strike is hard to understand. GM might have come to the negotiating table with some tough proposals, but ultimately the company appears to have bailed on mostly everything except the question of using temporary workers to align its cost with its Detroit competition and with the plants in the South.\nThe UAW has been grousing about how profitable GM has been over the past three years, as US auto sales have boomed, but the hourly workforce has gotten an average of $11,000 in annual profit sharing each year, and in 2019, if the membership approves a new four-year contract, it could get another $8,000.\nThe union is also playing chicken with GMs credit rating, which could fall into junk territory if a strike drags on, making it more expensive for the company to borrow and undermining its ability to invest in the expansion of electric mobility that could secure the UAW membership a brighter future (GM representation has declined by about about 20,000 since the last action against the company, a short-lived strike in 2007 when about 70,000 workers walked off).\nDont get me wrong: collective bargaining is collective bargaining — its rarely pretty. I also like to remind young journalists coming into the business of covering cars and planes that both industries remain significantly unionized in the US. Thats a fact of life. Both sides deserve a completely fair shake.\nBut unfortunately whats been happening with the GM strike — being the largest since 1982 and intersecting with the woolly leftism of several presidential candidates — is that the walkout has taken on an alarmingly romantic quality. A declining labor movement is flexing its muscle against a company that had to be bailed out by the taxpayer in 2009 and has been racking up the earnings ever since. Time to share the wealth!\nBunk. GM has already shared the wealth. The company is also deviating from its strategy of \"right-sizing\" its global manufacturing footprint, to deal with the most ruinous problem in car-making: excess capacity. In a US market thats peaked at around 17 million in annual vehicle sales, with the market share of about a dozen companies completely locked in, GM still has enough extra capacity to build a million vehicles.\nTo sweeten its offer to the UAW, the company reversed course on a 2018 decision to shutter a factory in Ohio that had been living on borrowed time for years, while also rescuing a Detroit-area plant slated to be idled by earmarking it for a new electric truck. (GM now wants to set up a unionized battery factory near its Lordstown, Ohio, facility.)\nOld-school confrontations versus a partnership with business\nEmbattled UAW President Gary Jones.\nReuters\nI could go on. Chatter around the car business suggests that GMs offer to the UAW is a good offer (Ive asked the UAW for their thoughts and havent yet gotten a response). Based on the usual picket-line interviews, the membership has been well-prepared to articulate its position: we want a bigger piece of the pie, we want cars to build in the US, and we want the temporary workers to have a better life.\nGMs offer looks as though it would deliver most of that. The strike, then, is theatrics.\nI get it. The union has to do something, and not just to distract from a corruption scandal thats rocked its leadership, with the FBI raiding president Gary Jones house and alleging an embezzlement scheme. The UAW is failing at its mission, which is to sell its expertise and negotiating skill in places like California and Tennessee.\nRead more: Trumps plan to revoke Californias power to set its own automotive-emissions standards isnt about cars or California — its about Obama\nThe reason for this isnt that complicated. The union is drifting back to the idea that management must be confronted, and that if a strike threat isnt real, then Big Auto will ultimately triumph in every confrontation. The wind is sort of at its back.\nSome modern advocates of organized labor, striving to link unionization with matters such as inequality and corporate malfeasance, have decided that Big Labors choice to become a partner with employers was stupid. That was just a neoliberal stab at turning outfits such as the UAW into blue-collar management consultants — the time has come to put down the Chardonnay and hoist the Bud Light, along with the picket signs.\nOther labor experts also think that strikes beget strikes and have joined the very real struggle of teachers in West Virginia with the notion that for labor to reassert its relevance (only about 10% of US workers are unionized, well down from peak mid-20th-century levels) it has to engage in shows of strength. The UAW had in fact been doing this since the beginning of the year, saber-rattling and girding for a strike; by some measure, even if GM hadnt given away the farm with its offer, the membership still would have had to walk.\nBut the strike is still pointless. GM doesnt have that much left to give up.\nMaybe I shouldnt say pointless. The display of labor power, even if its limited to a few weeks, could move the needle in Tennessee and encourage the hapless Tesla organizers to get their act together.\nThe strike has a silver lining for GM\nA Chevy being assembled at GMs Lordstown plant, before the factory was idled.\nGM\nInterestingly, the strike isnt all bad for GM, despite estimated daily losses of $50 million in revenue. The car maker has about 80 days worth of inventory, which is enough to fully stock dealerships for a few weeks. But at this point in the year, with only a quarter remaining before the books are closed on 2019, the stockpile of vehicles was looking a little hefty. The strike could bring that into a better fit with demand.\nCall it the silver lining. The undiscussed benefits of a walkout dont make the decision to reject GMs offer and throw the contract into chaos any less baffling. What makes this all really troubling is that GM and UAW, as they always have before, will achieve a new agreement. The workforce isnt going to stay out for months, at $250 per week in strike pay, with some relatively minor points left to resolve.\nOrganized labor advocates insist that for workers to get a better deal, they must grow their ranks and increase their bargaining power. For them, the GM strike — given the rarity of old-school, heavy-industry actions — could be symbolic.\nRead more: With Teslas Elon Musk and Rivians RJ Scaringe, we have the Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan of electric vehicles\nIn many ways, it regrettably already is. If you look at the facts, the UAW has lost membership, has been unable to organize plants that it should have, and backed itself into a corner with GM, which sensibly thought it was pre-empting a strike by producing an offer that the membership likely would have rushed to ratify.\nThis is what weve come to: Labor as spectacle. Not that we should be shocked. Politics is also spectacle, more so than at any time I can remember in my life, and if the UAW wants to use that to its advantage, it needs to get in on the game, especially with a national election in 2020 and the White House up for grabs.\nWhats lost is context. And with it, judgment. This is where business is supposed to shine in America, as stakeholders work out their differences and move toward shared goals, regardless of whats happening in politics, much of which is downright silly, and whats happening in the larger culture, which can become as unpredictable as it was in the 1960s or as staid as it was in the 1950s and to a lesser degree, the 1980s.\nThe country relies on the broad concept of good faith — the idea that various actors genuinely believe in their positions and are willing to both stand up for them and to give ground when the other side provides a valid alternative — to support the main pillars of society: civics and culture, politics, and business.\nGood faith is breaking down all over the place, taking good judgment with it. If you have any doubts, you can look at President Donald Trump or at his feckless Republican enablers in Congress. But what might be more troubling is the shellacking that American business is being subjected to now, much of it based on a bad-faith exploitation of world-historical events that business didnt have that much to do with (and by \"business\" I dont mean \"finance\" — the two have separated in their priorities since the 1980s). Thats coming from the left and the right.\nI wouldnt have expected it to come from the UAW, which has been around long enough to have a beneficial relationship with American business. But bad faith is what its fallen into with the GM strike, and once you cross that bridge, its hard to come back.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

(Chuck Burton/Associated Press)\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .]\nTesla owners in Hampton Roads, Va., who have had to go to Richmond or Raleigh, N.C., for in-person service that the company’s mobile-repair teams couldn’t handle, may get a shorter trip.\nThe Silicon Valley electric carmaker has signed a lease for a 9,580-square-foot space that was previously home to a Progressive Insurance service center. It would be just the third service center in all of Virginia besides those near Richmond and in Vienna.\nA representative with Divaris Real Estate, which brokered the lease, confirmed the automaker plans to use the site for repairs.\nWhat it won’t be is a dealership.\nMusk\nThe company run by Elon Musk has been pulling back from opening new stores, even announcing earlier this year that it would shutter most and sell exclusively online before reversing course not long after. Bloomberg News quoted Musk telling analysts during a recent earnings call that service centers, not stores, are more important to car sales.\nTesla has two stores in the state near its existing service centers but not without controversy. Virginia bars car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. That’s why the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA) was none too pleased when Tesla first came to the state.\nTesla won the ability to open its first Northern Virginia store only after a legal settlement when it appealed the state DMV commissioner’s adverse decision in 2013. It opened its Richmond store in 2017 after the DMV commissioner determined it could because there were no available, independent dealers who could sell the cars in the public interest despite several voicing a willingness to do so.\nWANT MORE NEWS? Listen to todays Daily Briefing\nConsidering Tesla’s unique business model of selling the cars at a uniform price online and in stores, it would make it difficult for an independent dealer to make a profit if the automaker didn’t offer discounts or wholesale prices. If the dealer didn’t make a profit, it might shutter, leaving Tesla owners in a lurch, the commissioner concluded.\nThe dealers group sued, but in June, a Richmond Circuit Court judge sided with the automaker. VADA has appealed that decision to the state’s supreme court arguing, in part, that the commissioner’s decision was based on “nothing more than an assumption that Tesla, as opposed to dealers, could be profitable even though Tesla failed to submit any evidence supporting its own profitability.”\nThe company hasn’t made an annual profit since going public in 2010.\nDon Hall, the president and CEO of the dealers association, says his fear is if Tesla goes out of business, there won’t be any independent dealerships or service stations.\n“When they [Tesla] pull the plug, you’re going to have a lot of people who are injured,” he said. “That day will happen, and I will sit back and say I told you so.”\nMore Content About:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-27'),

A passerby saw Loki in Hunt’s Model S and notified local police. Hunt explained to a representative from the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that the vehicle was operating in Dog Mode, and that he was able to control the temperature from his phone.\nDespite this, Hunt was charged for violating the country’s Animal, Health and Welfare Act.

In fact, it is almost always a very bad idea (even more so when we’re talking electric cars), yet the owner of a Tesla Model X thought they’d give it a shot during a recent flood in Mitchell, South Dakota.\nAs local news reporter Colton Molesky was filming a segment about the local flood, a white Tesla Model X came into view and was filmed making a dangerous crossing. Molesky is evidently shocked by what he sees and we don’t blame him.\nIt appears as though the water may have been about 1.5 feet deep at some points and as the Model X makes its way across, water rushes over the hood and approaches the windscreen. The electric SUV also creates a fairly significant wave as it pushes through the water, forcing the news reporter to actually jump out of the way.\nadvertisement scroll to continue\nAlso Watch: Like A Boss – Tesla Model S Driver Ignores Deep Floodwater, Emerges Victorious\nThe Tesla Model X impressively makes it through the water without any issues but that’s not the most important lesson to learn from watching this video.

There were no surprise vehicles at the end of the crossover’s presentation, nor were there any announcements about the number of pre-orders the electric car maker received for the seven-seater. Tesla has been pretty quiet about the Model Y since, too, as updates on the crossover have mostly come through insider reports and patent applications from the company.\nIt is through these patent applications that one could see the potential of the Model Y to revolutionize Tesla’s overall manufacturing operations. A look at two patents that are tailor-fit for the Model Y, for example, suggests that Tesla will be adopting a far more innovative production process for the vehicle compared to its past electric cars, including the mass-market Model 3 sedan, a vehicle that is essentially carrying Tesla into its current transition into a mainstream car manufacturer. With this in mind, the Model Y could even be described as a Trojan Horse of sorts, carrying the electric car maker’s innovations (mostly) under the radar.\nA patent for Tesla’s rigid wiring system. (Credit: US Patent Office)\nOne of these innovations is a rigid wiring system that will allow Tesla to drastically reduce the wiring of the Model Y compared to its older stablemates. Using the company’s design outlined in its patent, Tesla is expected to use only around 100 meters of wiring for the Model Y, far less than the 1.5 km of cabling used in the Model 3. Such a design also aids the company’s automation initiatives, as the rigid wiring harness will be easier to install by the company’s robots.\nAnother, even more notable innovation lies in a patent for a “Multi-Directional Unibody Casting Machine for a Vehicle Frame and Associated Methods” that seems to have been teased by company executives in the past. Elon Musk has mentioned that the company’s new casting machine will have the capability to cast pretty much the entire body of a vehicle in one piece, essentially eliminating the need for numerous welds across the body. “When we get the big casting machine, it’ll go from 70 parts to 1 with a significant reduction in capital expenditure on all the robots to put those parts together,” Musk said.\nA patent for Tesla’s giant casting machine. (Credit: US Patent Office)\nThese new innovations outlined in Tesla’s patent applications hint at the Model Y being the company’s first vehicle to adopt such designs in its wiring and casting. This is great news for the company’s upcoming vehicles like the Tesla Pickup Truck, the Semi, and the next-generation Roadster, all of which will likely benefit from these optimizations. More importantly, this is also great news for the Model 3.\nTesla’s struggles with the Model 3 ramp in the United States have been well-documented, as the company had to abandon a widely-automated approach to producing the vehicle to one that was more balanced between humans and machines. With the Model Y, Tesla could essentially start anew and experiment with more ambitious and manufacturing models once more. Fortunately for the Model 3, the vehicle shares about 75% of its parts with the Model Y, which means that production improvements that work for the crossover would likely be applicable for the midsize sedan as well.\nThe Tesla Model Y’s manufacturing revolution might begin sooner than expected, especially with the start of production at the company’s Gigafactory 3 site in Shanghai. Gigafactory 3 is designed to produce affordable versions of the Model 3 and Model Y for the Chinese market, suggesting that the facility will be optimized for speed and volume. It would then be interesting to see how Tesla produces the Model 3 (and later, the Model Y) on the site, as it could provide a glimpse at how much the company has improved based on lessons learned from the electric sedan’s ramp in the United States.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-25'),

The 56-year-old Riverview man driving the truck was taken to Osceola Regional Medical Center to be treated for minor injuries, troopers said.\nThe crash remains under investigation, according to the Highway Patrol.\nThe representative with the law firm said their team is focusing on a possible autopilot or lane assist malfunction, since the crash report indicates that the car went into oncoming traffic, which they say raises questions about Tesla, a company known to promote its collision avoidance technology.\nAttorneys Mike Morgan and Andrew Parker Felix specialize on automotive failures and product liability and are leading the investigation, according to the law firm representative.\nThe representative released the following statement regarding the investigation:\n\"Weve been retained to investigate a recent death where a 2019 Tesla Model 3 unexpectedly crossed into oncoming traffic.

It consolidates the multiple components needed for energy management with home solar or storage—including the traditional panel, gateway, and transformers—into one product, with which customers “can easily adopt solar, storage, electric vehicles, and other clean energy technologies,” the company says.\nThe Span panel essentially catches the home electrical panel up with the times, and makes it an internet of things (IoT) device that can be managed via smartphone app, helping you schedule vehicle charging and various home systems so that you use the least power off the grid .\nSpan panel app\nThe effort is led by Arch Rao, the former head of Tesla Energy and it includes engineers who brought the Tesla Powerwall to market.\nAesthetically, the Span panel looks much like the Powerwall, too. It can manage energy storage and power an entire house in a pinch, during a blackout. Adding more solar or storage is a “plug-and-play” process most of the time.\n“Electrical panels haven’t seen significant innovations in over three decades despite being the ideal center for controlling home energy and bringing intelligent connectivity into homes,” said Rao in a press release accompanying the product’s announcement. “We are excited to launch a product that will accelerate the adoption of renewables while transforming the customer and installer experience.”\nSpan also says that as solar and other distributed energy grows it could potentially be able to use the panels together as a fleet, before a true smart grid arrives some decades from now.\nThe company says that installation can be done with electrical contractors just like installing a new panel. Installations of the Span panel will start with “select market leaders” in California and Hawaii later this year. Span plans to scale up production in early 2020.\nIf word spread that it just works, and more people are likely to feel less intimidated about going solar, that sounds like it could really accomplish some good.\nTags:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-20'),

The noisemakers have been fitted on the Silicon Valley-based company’s electric cars that were manufactured after September 1, 2019.\nThe mandate, set by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), was mainly put into place in order to keep pedestrians safe. The NHTSA passed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, making it mandatory for electric vehicle manufacturers to install noisemakers in their vehicles by September 1, 2020. Tesla has installed the speaker into its vehicles a full year before it is required. The addition of the noisemakers was first reported by Trevor Page of Tesla Owners Online , who received word of them from a Tesla technician.\nBREAKING: @Tesla technician informs me that all #Model3s built since 9/1 have a pedestrian warning speaker installed that emits noise below 19 mph while in forward and while in reverse.\nWaiting for more details.\n— Tesla Owners Online (@Model3Owners) September 9, 2019\nThe noisemaker will affect the Model 3 , Model S and Model X and will be activated when a vehicle is traveling between 0 and 19 miles per hour, as electric cars emit little to no sound when moving at those speeds. It will be capable of two separate noises, one for forward and one for reverse.\nTesla owner-enthusiast RyanVision uploaded a video showing his Red Multi-Coat Model 3 emitting both noises, which gets louder as the speed of the vehicle increases. Based on the footage of the Model 3, the noise when the car is driving forward seems very similar to pink noise, or at least the sound of an aircraft flying overhead. The sound for reverse, on the other hand, is quite futuristic. There will likely be no confusion between the two noises and pedestrians will be able to differentiate between whether the approaching vehicle is moving forward or backward.\nThe NHTSA decided noisemakers needed to be added to electric vehicles after an October 2009 report stated that blind pedestrians were at higher risk for injury when around quieter vehicles. They anticipate that the addition of noisemakers will prevent between $250M and $320M in damages and save the lives of countless pedestrians.\nTesla’s vehicles are already known as some of the safest vehicles for drivers and passengers. The Model 3 recently received a 5-star safety rating in separate crash tests from the IIHS , NHTSA and ANCAP .

The bizarre turn of events led to revelations of Musk’s “ giant dick ”, Banks issuing – then deleting – a public apology , and the Tesla CEO being sued for fraud (earlier this year, it was reported that Banks and Grimes may have to testify ).\nOne year later and it seems the rivalry was never put to rest, as Banks has announced the release of an upcoming track that appears to imagine Musk’s “public execution”. In a now-deleted Instagram post , the rapper shared details of one of two songs that were filtered out of her recent 30-minute release, “ Yung Rapunxel Pt II ”.\nSet in 3030, “96’ Corolla (Motorman)” tells the story of ‘Alon Dust’, “a wealthy technocrat” who “devises the perfect scheme to entice poor people into allowing their brains to be used as an interface”. Coincidentally the venture is called ‘Neuralink’, the name of Musk’s company that’s actually working on mind-reading software.\nIn Banks’ song, Alon Dust’s “neural activity” is eventually cut off by the “AI Overlord” – played by the musician herself – “rendering him a vegetable and erasing him as a threat to humanity”.\nIn honour of this new chapter in our favourite feud, we look back at Banks’ most savage Musk burns – please bear in mind they’re straight from the playground, which means they’re awful and incredible – ranking them from first-degree to Get Me To The Crematorium.\nRead More\n— sidney fussell (@sidneyfussell) September 17, 2019\nHER DISGUST AT A THREESOME SUGGESTION\nDuring her time at Chateau Musk, Banks came to the conclusion that she was actually invited there for a threesome, rather than the music collaboration she signed up for. The rapper said that in the run-up to the meeting, she was told by Grimes that her boyfriend thought she was hot. In response to what she described as “some weird threesome sex shit”, Banks delivered our first burn of the list: “The nerve of these crackheads to think I would put my fully human lips on them.” The suggestion here being that not only is Musk addicted to crack cocaine, but he’s also an alien who is too “ crusty ” for Banks to kiss.\nDegree of burn: Touching the crack pipe when it’s a little bit too hot\nDECLARING HE HAD A ‘SHRINKING DICK’\nIn this drag, Banks insinuated Musk was using Grimes, only taking her to the Met Gala – where they revealed their relationship – to “hide his shrinking dick from Amber Heard ”. Musk dated Heard from 2016 before the two split up a year later, reuniting six months after that, and breaking up again the following month (three months before the Met Gala). Dragging someone’s dick size is a classic schoolyard jape, but it’s also incredibly uncreative. Banks can do better IMO.\nDegree of burn: A UTI that clears up in two to three days with a course of antibiotics\nJust when you think it doesnt get crazier than Elon vs. the shorts, you find out about the Azealia Banks Vs. Grimes/Elon craziness and realize THERE COULD BE SO MANY MORE LEVELS OF CRAZY TO GO. $TSLA pic.twitter.com/A5YEqwXbP1\n— Jeremy C. Owens (@jowens510) August 13, 2018\n‘TRASH ASS BETA MALE PIG’\nHere, Banks has gone for a handful of neat insults rolled into one devastating put-down: quick to deliver, absolutely searing to take. “This trash ass beta male pig,” Banks eloquently begins , “was given his start in life because his disgusting racist parents took advantage of thousands of black people… Ask Elon Musk what the fuck he does for Africa?” The rapper continued on her ‘weak man’ ridicule, later describing the billionaire as “a beta male who took steroids and got hair plugs to convince himself he was alpha”. Puny, pathetic, and bald – take that, Musk.\nDegree of burn: Tucking into your hog roast before it cools down (sorry, vegetarians)\n‘I WOULDN’T GIVE HIM THE CREDIT OF CALLING HIM AN ALIEN’\nThis is not the first time Banks has alluded to Musk’s otherworldly heritage (see above), but it is the inaugural introduction of the entrepreneur’s backstory. “I wouldn’t give him the credit of calling him an alien,” delivered the rapper (a nice implication here that potentially mythological aliens are higher up in the food chain than Musk). “He’s a mutant. His humanoid group emerged/crawled out of the Caucasus cave system 15,000 years after the first caucasian homosapiens did.” This is maybe one of the most creative burns on the list, and actually paints a picture that I kind of… believe? Like, yes this is obviously how Musk was born.\nDegree of burn: Re-entering the sweltering darkness of your Caucasus birth cave\nRIP Grimes & Elon Musk. Long live Azealia Banks pic.twitter.com/sPxdlZ4GEY\n— Andy Jackson Ⓥ (@andyjacksson) August 13, 2018\n‘UNGRATEFUL TECHNOCRAT WHOSE EGO IS TOO BIG FOR HIS BRITCHES’\nThis isn’t actually a particularly good drag, but to give credit where credit is due, Banks has written a whole song about how much she hates Musk. Not only has she spent time crafting music and lyrics inspired by her deep loathing, but she’s fucking killed him off! In a public execution! Where the “people rejoice”! Too hot to touch.\nDegree of burn: I mean, Musk is dead, isn’t he?\n‘THIN GREY LIPS AND FROGGY EYELIDS’\nThis is basically the written version of the school bully giving you a noogie during morning break. It’s pathetic, yes, but it’s also so unbelievably humiliating that you still remember it to this day. The burn goes: “He’s ugly. The thin grey lips and froggy eyelids. Un-uniformed hair growth pattern. Pork skin.” The most perfect thing about this drag is the mundanity of it all; the fact that chastising the uniformity of how someone’s hair grows is now a biting insult leaves absolutely no-one safe. With this burn, Banks has completely changed the way the world works, and we should all be terrified.\nDegree of burn: Being turned into dust at the Crematorium\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-19'),

The enterprise program is also under full Apple control, meaning the company can revoke access to it from anyone at any time. Testut says he has a new method that may be a bit harder to shut down.\nIt does involve installing the companion AltServer application on your Mac or Windows PC, plugging in your iOS device, and manually installing the AltStore software on the phone or tablet. That requires you also input your Apple ID with an app-specific password, which can be generated online from Apple’s dedicated Apple ID management portal.\nThat said, once the software is on your phone, it’s indistinguishable from software you’ve developed yourself, compiled in Xcode, and installed on your own device, Testut says. AltStore also uses iTunes Wi-Fi sync to ensure the app refreshes weekly, to avoid being forcibly removed from your device after seven days in accordance with how apps not installed through the App Store function on iOS. (Beta software using TestFlight or the enterprise program function differently.)\nIn that sense, it works very much like the existing Cydia Impactor tool for installing iOS application files. Yet instead of just letting you install random app files, it installs an entire app store capable of distributing its own secondary software.\nAltStore works by tricking Apple into thinking you’ve developed the app yourself\nThat doesn’t mean Apple can’t shut it down. It may have some method of doing so, but Testut says he’s not sure it would be easy for Apple to do so without also removing the ability for DIY developers, schools, and other organizations that rely on that foundational iOS infrastructure to build test apps and software for internal use.\n“It would be interesting, because everything I’m doing, Apple is doing themselves,” Tesut told The Verge of the project earlier this year, when it was still in development. “One heavy-handed approach is they [Apple] could completely shut down the whole service, but that would affect everyone doing this, including schools. Anyone just using their free Apple ID on the side.”\nBesides that, Testut imagines Apple could disable the ability to sync over Wi-Fi, but that would just mean plugging in your phone once a week to continue using AltStore and the apps it distributes. “I don’t know how fast they’d react and what they would do, but even in the worst case, I think there’s still a path forward for AltStore. As long as iTunes can sync apps, Alt Store can work,” he said.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-09-25'),

Shares are up nearly 40% in the past month and more than 60% in the past three months.\nThat’s pushed the stock back into positive territory for the year. (It still lags the performance of GM, Ford (F) , Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and many other big auto makers, however.)\nTesla’s strong earnings and sales last month were a key catalyst behind its recent rebound. Musk also said during the company’s last earnings conference call that production plans for the Model Y – which he predicted will outsell the Model 3 as well as its higher end S sedan and X crossover “combined” – are ahead of schedule. The Y should launch in the summer of 2020 instead of in the fall.\nThose are key reasons why Wall Street now expects Tesla will post a profit in the fourth quarter – and for all of 2020.\nMusk is looking to capitalize on the momentum with plans to build a new European gigafactory for lithium-ion batteries and vehicles in Berlin – the city in which VW was founded. Tesla is also building a gigafactory in Shanghai to take on Chinese rivals Nio (NIO) , BAIC Motor and BYD (BYDDF) , a company backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) .\nThe bear case against Tesla\nMany analysts are still wary of Tesla.

Not all of these plants are explicitly for vehicle assembly, but they could be if needed. By reckoning, this means Tesla has committed to building more factories than any other established automaker in the world.\nTesla could offer some industrial logic for a plant in Shanghai, given that China is likely to be the worlds best growth market for all-electric vehicles and that Western car companies prefer to build vehicles where they sell them.\nBut Europe is a far different story.\nCapacity utilization in the auto-manufacturing sector is in the low-80% range, an embedded structural problem that business leaders in the industry have been worrying about for a decade (the late Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne made a big deal out of the issue in a widely debated 2015 presentation unsubtly titled \" Confessions of a Capital Junkie \").\nA mature market with limited future growth and too many underutilized factories\nThe late Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne.\nThomson Reuters\nThe European auto market is large and mature, and it probably doesnt have much growth to look forward to. A wildcard is a switchover to electrification, driven by rising government emissions and fuel-economy standards and problems with diesel engines in the aftermath of Volkswagens cheating scandal.\nElectric cars wont really solve the overcapacity problem, however. Europe could abandon internal-combustion completely and still have ... 20% of its car factories operating below full levels.\nEnter Tesla. CEO Elon Musk was in Germany last week to attend the annual Golden Steering Wheel awards handed out by Business Insiders fellow Axel Springer publication, Auto Bild. Never one to miss an opportunity to keep Tesla enthusiasm high, Musk gave the German audience what it wanted and announced the Berlin Gigafactory.\nAuto manufacturing is somewhat variable; there are operational factories in the world that have been around since the early 20th century. Teslas main assembly plant, in Northern California, was opened in the 1960s (Tesla bought it after the financial crisis). But for the most part, automaking in the 21st century outside bespoke operations for expensive exotic cars is a commodified process.\nMusk has proposed, repeatedly, to reinvent this situation by creating highly automated factories, but Tesla had wound up with exactly the opposite: improvised outdoor assembly lines in California and a higher headcount indoors than Fremont had when it was a joint General Motors-Toyota plant in the 1980s.\nMaybe Giga Berlin could rectify this, but that really wouldnt address the general overcapacity problem. The bottom line is that Europe doesnt need more car plants.\nWhats Musks motive? Its mysterious ...\nTesla California factory.\nTesla\nIn this context, its mysterious, if not to say mystifying, that Musk would want to build a new factory. There are plenty of plants that European automakers would be happy to sell him, for a song, and there are also contract manufacturers — such as Austrias Magna — who could start assembling Tesla vehicles faster than Tesla could construct and all-new facility.\nIts worth noting that while Teslas ambitions sound great, these new Gigafactories are all billion-dollar propositions — and Tesla is undertaking them with borrowed 2019 money. If theyre in operation for 30 years, inflation should take care of the debt burden. But much of the competition built its plants with money gathered decades ago. And some of those factories are either slated to close or are running well below full capacity. Ford is reducing its European footprint to 18 from 23 plants and reducing shifts.\nThis ought to represent a happy hunting ground for Tesla, and Musk might still buy rather than build. But obviously, constructing something shiny and new sounds sexier.\nBeyond the European overcapacity issue, any new Tesla factory is likely to replicate, depressingly, Tesla bungling approach to auto assembly. At a time when every other major automaker has adopted an industry standard \"lean\" manufacturing model, pioneered and refined by Toyota in the 1970s and 1980s, Tesla continues to operate more like the GM of the 1950s (or, with its improvised assembly line, the Ford of the 1910s).\nMusks cult of \"production hell\"\nMusk makes everything difficult.\nDavid McNew/AFP/Getty Images\nThe output is pretty compelling; Tesla makes a nice car. But Musk has also created a cult of \"production hell\" thats simply baffling to industry professionals who are used to vehicles moving uneventfully from launch to production in a year or two. Germany, an industrial powerhouse, is especially good at this, so Musk parachuting in with his zany ideas might not go over all that well.\nBut honestly, he shouldnt bother. Or maybe he should, if his overarching goal is to keep the Tesla story fresh (it is). Tesla already has a sort-of factory in Europe, located in the Netherlands, but its a final-assembly hub, completing vehicles shipped from the US. A soup-to-nuts factory in Europes industrial heartland is a much more compelling plot point.\nIn many ways, Musk deserves his reputation for genius. He is by far the greatest living car salesman, a throwback to the giants of the business: Henry Ford, Enzo Ferrari, William Durant. But when it comes to the blocking-and-tackling stuff, his genius is useless. He constantly overcomplicates and reliably choosing the hard way when the easy way is staring him in the face.\nThe upshot is useful drama. But as Tesla gets bigger, the routine gets old. And if he really wants to sell more cars in Europe, there are much easier ways to do it than building a factory the continent doesnt need.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

It raised its 2020 EBIT guidance for Tesla 24% to $1.6 billion after the companys third quarter earnings showed a \" clear trend of cost performance, \" according to a Monday note.\nAs Tesla has produced more affordable versions of its cars, its shown that it can maintain gross margins —the difference between how much cars sell for and what they cost to make. In the third quarter, the gross margin excluding credit \"was above the 20% level from where we think Tesla starts building profitability,\" he wrote. Jefferies has forecast gross margin to be 23% by 2021, up from 18.8% in 2018.\nThe pricing of Model 3s made in China, plus deferred revenue recognition from Teslas Autopilot feature, suggest that average selling prices have stopped falling for now, and will pick back up again when the Model Y begins production in 2020 , according to Houchois.\nJefferies also boosted its full-year 2019 EBIT estimate by $83 million, and expects that capex for the fourth quarter will be between $550 million and $600 million, putting capex for the full year below $1.5 billion.\nImproved performance aside, Jefferies doesnt think that Tesla will have only smooth sailing from now on, according to the note. The fourth quarter could show weak delivery numbers, the companys low levels of capex are a concern, and there are \"risks inherent in ramping up the new plant in China,\" Houchois wrote.\nStill, an improved 2019 \"sets a better foundation for a return to growth in 2020 revenue and earnings,\" Houchois wrote.\nThe automaker has a consensus price target of $273.28 with 11 \"buy\" ratings, nine \"hold\" ratings, and 16 \"sell\" ratings, according to Bloomberg data.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-11'),

This means accumulating examples of computer vision errors from billions of miles of driving.\nHuman input is a source of signal. Human behavior can tell the machine its doing something wrong and, in some cases, can tell the machine how to do it right.\nWhether or not Tesla succeeds in developing full autonomy, it seems assured that Tesla will deploy partial autonomy in an urban setting.\nAndrej Karpathy, Teslas (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Senior Director of AI, recently gave a talk where he unveiled the tongue-in-cheek \"Operation Vacation\". The idea is to automate Teslas machine learning pipeline to the point where all the engineers can go on vacation and Teslas partially autonomous driving features will continue to improve automatically. The fleet will continue to upload data automatically, a workforce of hand-labelers will continue to label data where necessary, neural networks will be automatically trained on the new data, and then the improved networks will be deployed to the fleet. The cycle repeats.\nThe idea of the engineers going on vacation is tongue-in-cheek because there is always work to be done; innovation never stops. Moreover, even if the whole process could be fully automated, it would be wise to have people overseeing the machinery to see that its working as intended. But whats real is the concept of Autopilot, Summon, and other features improving largely automatically. Software development is traditionally a function of engineer labor. The goal of \"Operation Vacation\" is for Teslas engineers to be like factory engineers. They put a lot of work in for a long time until the factory is running. Once its running, it requires a large workforce of non-engineers to keep it running. The engineers are still needed to check up on the machines and fix problems as they arise or to make improvements. But, by and large, the factory is running independently of the engineers labor. By contrast, traditional software development is more like engineers artisanally crafting goods by themselves.\nA slide from Andrej Karpathys talk showing Teslas machine learning pipeline.\nThe idea for Tesla is to build an approach to autonomy that scales with data since Tesla has the largest fleet of sensor-equipped, computer-equipped, Internet-connected vehicles with which to collect data. The most significant bottleneck in this approach is the cost to pay human labelers. On computer vision tasks where Tesla needs to continually add new, hand-labeled camera data to its training datasets in order to keep improving, the approach doesnt scale with the data thats available to collect but with the subset of data that Tesla can afford to label. It might be possible for Tesla to collect a trillion photos of traffic lights, but not to pay people to label them as red, green, or yellow.\nOn tasks that require hand-labeling, Teslas approach doesnt allow it to increase the sheer quantity of labeled data, but rather to speed up learning by attaining a higher quality of data. The most valuable examples to learn from are the ones where a neural network makes an error. Maybe it misclassifies an object, detects an object that isnt there, or fails to detect an object that is there. Tesla can source a higher quantity of these sorts of valuable examples than its competitors through the automatic processes that \"Operation Vacation\" represents.\nImagine a Tesla driving down a highway on Navigate on Autopilot (the version of Autopilot that can perform autonomous lane changes). The car autonomously initiates a lane change, failing to notice a pickup truck in the adjacent lane. The driver turns the wheel, disengaging Autopilot and canceling the lane change. This human intervention can trigger a snapshot that might include a short video clip from the Teslas eight cameras, radar data, GPS data, and so on. The video clip can be reviewed by Teslas human labelers, who see the pickup truck is not detected by Teslas neural network. The labelers draw a 3D box around the truck, label it \"light truck\", and send the labeled video clip along to Tesla HQ for inclusion in the training dataset.\nNow imagine a Tesla driving down a highway under full human control. The minivan ahead of the Tesla slams on its brakes and, in turn, the Tesla driver slams on the brakes as well. Running silently on the Teslas computer is the Autopilot software. It is quietly watching the human drivers trajectory, at each moment estimating the probability that Autopilot would take the same trajectory. In this case, the Autopilot software fails to detect the minivan. From Autopilots point of view, the human driver is randomly slamming on the brakes in the middle of an empty highway. Therefore, it assigns a low probability to the drivers trajectory; it is \"surprised\" by the drivers actions. This \"surprise\" or \"disagreement\" between the human-driven trajectory and the machine-generated trajectory can trigger a snapshot and an upload to Teslas data labelers. (This is my interpretation of the approach Tesla calls \"shadow mode\".)\nA fiendish thing about self-driving is that the lower your error rate gets, the more examples of errors you need to get that next halving of the error rate. As the quantity of errors your system generates decreases, the quantity of errors you need to sustain your rate of improvement increases. The more you need errors, the harder they are to find. Suppose Waymo ( GOOG , GOOGL ) has gotten serious computer vision errors (i.e. errors that would cause a vehicle misbehavior noticeable by a safety driver) down to one error per 10,000 miles. (This isnt a real figure, just a made-up one for illustrative purposes.) Since Waymo is driving approximately 1 million miles per month, only 100 serious computer vision errors will occur per month. Labeling error examples is now no problem, but getting them is hard. By contrast, if Waymo were driving 1 billion miles per month, 100,000 errors would occur. In this way, the number of error examples that can be collected scales with the number of miles driven.\nOver the 12 months since its release in November 2018, Navigate on Autopilot has driven 1 billion miles. Thats an average of 83 million miles per month. Going forward, that monthly figure will be far more since the fleet of Navigate on Autopilot-capable cars has roughly doubled over the last 12 months and it will probably increase by at least 50% over the next 12 months (assuming Teslas current production rate at least doesnt decrease). The total fleet with Autopilot Hardware 2 and above currently stands at around 650,000. Assuming average miles driven is the same as the American average , the total miles driven (both fully manual and Autopilot) is about 725 million per month. Both modes of driving provide fodder for \"Operation Vacation\", as explained above. On Autopilot, human interventions flag machine errors or situations the human driver thought too difficult for Autopilot. In manual mode, human-Autopilot \"disagreements\" flag machine errors as well.\nSo far, Ive only discussed elements of \"Operation Vacation\" where human labelers are in the loop. What about removing not just the engineers, but the labelers too? What about handing the whole process over to the machines?\nA surprising finding in machine learning is that if you use poorly labeled data, sometimes you can achieve the same results as with well-labeled data as long as you use something like a thousand times as much. Facebook ( FB ) found that Instagram hashtags, which often tenuously relate to what an image actually depicts, can be used to train a neural network to accurately classify objects. The trick is that Facebook used 1 billion images with hashtags to achieve roughly the same accuracy as with 1 million hand-labeled images. Facebook has also found that if you combine both kinds of images, you achieve greater accuracy than either kind of image on its own.\nTesla has an abundant source of poor labels in the form of its 650,000 human drivers. In whats known as a weakly supervised approach (in contrast to the fully supervised approach in which data is carefully hand-labeled), the sort of actions I described above as ways to flag data for hand-labeling could instead be treated as low-quality labels. When a human driver proceeds into space that Autopilot detects as obstructed, that space can automatically be labeled as unobstructed. Conversely, when a human driver stops ahead of space that Autopilot detects as all clear, that space can be labeled as containing an obstacle. This is a messy way to go about it, but its a way to supplement scarce, expensive labels with abundant, free labels. (You can read a research paper about this approach.)\nTeslas Autopilot job postings have long requested candidates who can \"[d]evise methods to use to enormous quantities of lightly labeled data in addition to a diverse set of richly labeled data.\" At Teslas Autonomy Day presentation , Karpathy described an approach similar to what Ive been describing. With video clips labeled by human steering, Tesla trained a neural network to perceive and extrapolate the curve and slope of the roadway ahead:\nWeakly supervised learning is an approach that truly scales with data. The limit is no longer human labor (neither engineers nor labelers), but rubber on the road, packets routed through the Internet, and the churning of GPUs at Tesla HQ. The machine learning process truly is just an elaborate machine that can operate on its own, as fast as its mechanical parts can move. The slow part is the development time the engineers have to spend setting up the process and getting it to work.\nPrediction is a much easier job for \"Operation Vacation\" than computer vision. When it comes to predicting the trajectories of cars and pedestrians, there is an abundant, free source of high-quality labels: the future. Make an observation about a cars current trajectory and over the next five seconds that car will, in effect, label that observation with its future trajectory. If you make a prediction about where a pedestrian will walk, that pedestrian will promptly show you how accurate your prediction is. Errors can thereby be automatically detected and error examples can be automatically labeled with the correct future trajectory. This is a dream scenario. Labor isnt a constraint, money isnt a constraint; only cars and computers are a constraint.\nPlanning is also a dream. Its the same principle with a different focus. The planner is trying to determine what actions the car should take. The observation is the full driving scene, seen by the eight surround cameras and the forward radar. In manual mode, the neural network predicts what the human Tesla driver will do, automatically flagging an error if it predicts wrong. (Again, this is my interpretation of \"shadow mode\".) The driver labels the observed driving scene with their actions. On Autopilot, its the same except an error is flagged whenever the human intervenes. This approach, known as imitation learning, was recently used by DeepMind to train neural networks that can play StarCraft better than over 70% of human players. Imitation learning has also been explored by Waymo and its an approach favored by the self-driving car startup Aurora . (Waymo and Aurora, however, lack the scale of training data provided by Teslas 650,000 human drivers.)\nSo, I posit that \"Operation Vacation\" has four main pillars:\nAutomatic flagging of computer vision errors that are later uploaded and hand-labeled (fully supervised learning). Errors are flagged when a human driver disengages Autopilot or when, in manual mode, the Autopilot planner \"disagrees\" with (or is \"surprised\" by) a humans trajectory.\nAutomatic labeling of camera data using low-quality labels from human driving behavior (weakly supervised learning for computer vision). Training examples are uploaded when the computer vision neural network and the human driver \"disagree\", resulting in Autopilot generating a different trajectory than the one the human driver took.\nAutomatic labeling for prediction. Future events label past events and show when a prediction is in error.\nAutomatic labeling for planning. Human driving behavior provides the labels. Error is presumed when a human intervenes while Autopilot is active or when there is a \"disagreement\" between the human and the Autopilot planner.\nPrediction and planning depend on computer vision to track object trajectories and to observe the driving scene. A computer vision error may cause prediction or planning to fail. So, computer vision has to be solved for everything else to work optimally.\nConversely, a prediction or planning error may trigger the upload of a video clip that doesnt generate any computer vision errors. Incorrectly flagged clips increase the workload for humans doing manual review. Reducing prediction and planning errors can, therefore, save labelers time and let them focus on computer vision errors. By improving the accuracy of automatic flagging, progress on prediction and planning can help speed along progress on computer vision.\nBy developing an approach that scales as much as possible with data and as little as possible with labor, Teslas engineers are out on the frontier of large-scale machine learning for autonomous vehicles. Automatic flagging of errors makes labelers labor more efficient. Leveraging imitation learning reduces the work engineers need to put into a planner; rather than laboriously hand-coding every driving behavior, behaviors can be learned from data. With 725 million miles of driving to draw on every month, there is no precedent in the field of autonomous vehicles to indicate how effective Teslas approach will be.\nSome skeptics argue that solving computer vision is impossible . Maybe so. We wont know for sure unless and until it happens.\nDeveloping a Level 2 system that fails and needs human intervention every 100 miles is a lot easier than developing a Level 4 or 5 system that fails every 1 million miles. Even if Tesla falls far short of the goal of full autonomy, its almost a foregone conclusion that Tesla will be able to develop a Level 2 system for driving on city streets. The main question lingering over this prospect is whether, as machine errors become more and more infrequent, drivers will remain vigilant and intervene when necessary or whether they will be lulled into a false sense of security. Tesla may need to implement driver monitoring to ensure that drivers are paying attention. The combination of a driver-facing camera and the existing steering wheel torque sensor would presumably be more effective than the torque sensor on its own.\nThe hyper-bullish scenario for Tesla is that it develops full autonomy and deploys robotaxis. In that scenario, Teslas market cap could roughly double or triple , if not dectuple . The mildly bullish scenario is that Tesla releases a Level 2 system for urban driving and its so good that Tesla sells more cars and more units of the \"Full Self-Driving\" add-on. Sales growth and automotive gross margin are two key metrics investors are watching; Teslas urban Level 2 system could be an unexpected contributor to both.\nAndrej Karpathys talk in which he describes \"Operation Vacation\".\nThis article was written by\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-12'),

In that report, Tesla notably detailed a surprise adjusted ( non-GAAP ) profit of $1.86 per share -- smashing estimates for an adjusted loss of $0.42 per share -- despite an 8% revenue decline, to roughly $6.3 billion.\nIMAGE SOURCE: TESLA.\nSo what\nTesla set fresh records for both vehicle production and deliveries -- which grew to 96,000 and 97,000 units, respectively -- during the quarter. But its top line shrank because the bulk of those unit sales (nearly 80,000) came from Teslas lower-priced Model 3 sedan, deliveries for which soared 42% year over year, putting the company firmly on track to exceed the lower end of its ambitious goal for deliveries of 360,000 to 400,000 units.\nEven so, Tesla was able to simultaneously reduce its operating expenses by 16% while generating a staggeringly better-than-expected $371 million in free cash flow (versus estimates for just $32 million) during the quarter.\nNow what\nIf that wasnt enough, Tesla gave investors several reasons to be excited for whats to come.\nFor one, Tesla confirmed its Shanghai Gigafactory is now producing full vehicles on a trial basis as it awaits local government approval that should pave the way for ramped production at the Chinese facility. Tesla further teased that it believes \"China could become the biggest market for Model 3.\"\nAnd Teslas vehicle lineup is poised to expand into two lucrative segments. First, Tesla said its Model Y compact crossover vehicle launch is ahead of schedule, with production now expected by the summer of 2020. Then, subsequent to last months update, Tesla CEO Elon Musk separately confirmed the company will unveil its widely anticipated pickup truck model at an event on Nov. 21, 2019.\nFinally, thats not to mention the potential for Teslas new third-generation Solar Roof product , installations of which Musk has said the company hopes to ramp \"as fast as possible\" to more than 1,000 roofs per week in the coming months.\nOf course, most investors know to take some of those promises with a grain of salt given Musks history of setting audacious goals. But considering Teslas massively improved operational efficiency in the meantime last quarter, its no surprise that shares rallied in response last month.\nSteve Symington owns shares of Tesla.

The Model 3 is the only car on the list that is fully electric, although there are a number of hybrid cars in use.\nThere are no Teslas in use as New York taxis yet and no way to say, at this point, when we might actually see a Tesla Model 3 cab. Generally, cars only get a TLC certification when requested by an individual or fleet company.\nThere are Teslas already being used as “for hire” cars in New York City, said Allan Fromberg of the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. Those cars, which do not have the distinctive bright yellow paint and rooftop lights of a taxi and are not allowed to pick up riders who wave for them in the street, are held to a different set of rules than taxis. “For hire” cars could be Lyft or Uber cars or work for any of the so-called “black car” limousine services in New York. The requirements for those cars are somewhat less stringent than those for yellow cabs.\nThe Tesla Model 3 has met the requirements to be used as taxi in New York City.\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\nAmong other things, to qualify as a New York City taxi cab, a vehicle has to meet minimum requirements for interior space, it must have air conditioning for rear seat passengers and space to install the clear partition that separates the passengers in the backseat from the driver. The seats also have to be covered in easy-to-clean material like vinyl.\nOnce approved, a car can then be “hacked up,” or have all the equipment installed to make it into a taxi cab. That includes the required paint job, exterior lights and signage, the taxi meter, and interior partition.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-07'),

And Totally Not ... - Solar Quotes', 'NEWSLETTER\nHold on to your beards! Ronald’s spent the weekend in a brand new 2019 Tesla Model S. Here’s what happened…\nAllow me to transport some information to your eyes that is simply electrifying.  Finn, my boss, has bought a Tesla Model S electric sports car.  It is AWESOME.  I know this because he let me drive it for two days.  This joy ride convinced me the Tesla Model S is the best car in the world.  I’ll even go further and say that — with the information I currently have at hand — it is the best car in the universe.\nIts performance is flabbergasting, with acceleration so rapid it will be at least a least a week before my flabber catches up with me.  No petrol burning car in its price range comes anywhere close.  Revheads reading this may be able to name million dollar internal combustion cars that do better, but those don’t emit zero emissions from the vehicle or have the option of running completely off clean renewable energy, including solar power from your own panels.\nIt is, by far, the best car I have ever driven and there is one thing I am absolutely sure of — with a starting price of $149,000 it’s definitely not worth it.  Not for me.  It was fun to drive but not over $100,000 worth of fun.  I could get an awful lot of enjoyment out of 100 grand.  I would use it to swim with hotels and stay in fancy dolphins.\nBut your mileage may vary.  If you already spend this kind of money on cars I’m certain you’re doing yourself a disservice if you don’t get a Tesla.  And if you normally spend much more than this on cars, then get a Tesla Model S anyway.  You’ll probably like it and if you don’t a moneybags like you hasn’t really lost anything.  (If you don’t like it, just give it to me and I promise you’ll never see it again.)\nDriving a $150,000 sports car made me feel as though I was normally physically endowed. So around three inches taller.\nYou Can’t Trust Tesla\nI was going to tell you driving the Model S has convinced me to buy one of Tesla’s lower cost cars.  Maybe the Model 3 when it falls in price or possibly the still under development Model Y that should be even cheaper.  But then I checked the Tesla website and was instantly reminded of the kind of company they are and came crashing back down to earth.\nThe site is deceptive and I’m pretty confident it breaks Australian consumer law.  So while I can recommend their product to anyone in the market for a luxury car, I can’t recommend the company.  I wouldn’t leave Tesla alone with my grandmother because I don’t trust them not to sell her something she either doesn’t want or doesn’t need.  If you deal with Tesla you always need to double check what they say or imply is actually true.\nRemember, just because they’re not lying capitalist pigs making money from destroying the planet doesn’t mean they’re not lying capitalist pigs.  But then lying communist pigs produce sports cars like the 2-stroke Melkus RS 1000 , so it could be worse.\nBut enough depressing talk about Tesla’s perfidy.  Let me instead tell you how awesome their Tesla Model S electric car is!\nFinn Is Way Too Trusting\nFinn is very environmentally aware and so he’s eager to convince people to make the change to electric cars .  As a result, all I had to say to convince him to lend me his Tesla was:\n“In all my years of driving I’ve never had an accident or a ticket.”\nAnd it worked!  A more suspicious person might have asked:\n“But how many accidents did you directly cause?”\nOr possibly:\n“Exactly how many years have you been driving?  Is it more than zero?”\nBut he didn’t ask and all I can say is thank god for trust.  It lets me get away with so much!  I was surprised it worked since I had previously let it slip I only see in two dimensions and didn’t know humans were supposed to see in 3D before I saw Avatar . 1\nTesla has reduced the number of variants of the Model S so now there are only two types available in Australia:\nThe Model S Long Range version with a starting price of around $149,000.\nThe Model S Performance version with a starting price of around $174,000.\nFinn got the Standard Range version that Tesla discontinued just after he placed his order. The Standard Range has a 75 kilowatt-hour battery instead of a 100 kilowatt-hours, which is the only size available now. 2 Then he blew a big chunk of those savings away by paying for some “special features” such as the actual colour he wanted 3 as well as $8,500 for the very incorrectly named, “Full Self-Driving Capability”.\nThe invoice from Tesla Australia for the (now discontinued) Model S Standard Range.\nSo Much Acceleration!\nAt 8:20 on a beautiful Sunday morning Finn handed over the plastic doodad that can let you hop in and drive off without worrying about keys, although Finn has activated an extra safety feature where you need to enter a code number as well.  (He was very clever as he chose 1368 — the number of watts of sunshine energy per square meter at the top of the atmosphere.  No one will ever guess that!)  Then I picked up my son…\n…and Sam, my lives-a-bit-too-far-away-to-be-a-neighbour and went for a spin.\nI tried to resist at first, but it wasn’t long before I gave in to temptation and used more than just mild pressure on the accelerator:\nRONALD: Tell me what you think of the acceleration.  (Applies modest pressure to accelerator pedal.)\nSAM: GWARRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!   It’s…  It’s good.\nRONALD: Only good?  Let’s try that again.\nSAM: GWARRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  I knew it was coming, but I can’t stop making that sound!\nRONALD’S SON: Dad, was everything supposed to go dark except for a small circle in front of me where all the colour shifted to a blue haze?\nRONALD: That’s just the blood pooling in the back of your brain.  As you get older and start running low on blood you’ll see like that all the time.\nSAM: That’s not a normal part of aging.  That’s called tunnel vision and you shouldn’t be driving if you have it.  GWARRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\nRONALD’S SON: I think I want to get out of the car now.\nRONALD: Well, I’m not stopping, so you’re only allowed to jump out if we pass a hospital.\nAfter subjecting my passengers to several dozen more bursts of insane acceleration, we stopped in the German-themed hamlet of Hahndorf to recover with some beer, but since I was driving a $150,000 car I drank hardly any litres at all.\nHis mother doesn’t let him drink, so my son has to do some catching up when he’s with me. But don’t worry, I teach him to drink responsibly. He has to finish all his beer before getting another one.\nThe non-performance Tesla Model S can go from 0 to 100 kilometres an hour in 3.8 seconds.  This understates how well it accelerates in normal use around town because, thanks to the way electric motors work, the 0 to 50 time is under half that.  So whenever I wanted to merge into traffic and was wondering if a gap was large enough, the answer was always yes.  Maybe if I drove the Tesla long enough my perception of what counts as a gap would change and the answer wouldn’t always be yes, but that would take some time.  (In the interest of science I’m willing to see just how long it will take if someone wants to lend me their Tesla.)\nThe Model S battery is built into the floor and weighs 590 kilograms, giving a low centre of gravity.  With its all-wheel drive each tyre felt as though it was stuck to the road with an entire horse race worth of glue.  I felt more road traction stomping on the Tesla’s accelerator in the wet than when I’m parking my Hyundai.\nThe Performance version of the Tesla Model S goes from 0 to 100 in 2.6 seconds.  If you put the pedal to the metal it will accelerate faster than my Hyundai would if I drove it off a cliff.  That’s equal to the best a cheetah can manage and for a greyhound to beat that you’d have to glue two of them together.  It’s simply ludicrous.\nGoing For Speed\nBoth versions of the Tesla Model S have a top speed of 250 kilometers an hour.  So I’ve been told.  I don’t know because I didn’t go that fast.  It was easy to accidentally exceed the speed limit, but not that easy.  I only intentionally exceeded the speed limit one time and that was when I was overtaking.  All I know is the acceleration showed no sign of tapering off.  With the maximum legal speed being 130 kilometers an hour in the Northern Territory, the Tesla Model S’s top speed is irrelevant to Australians unless you have a racetrack handy.\nGoing For Distance\nThe thing people people are usually most worried about when it comes to electric cars — range — is not an issue.  Unless you’re a traveling salesperson or something, the problem is fixed if you drive a Tesla.\nWhen fully charged the Tesla Model S Long Range version can travel around 560 kilometers. 4 I didn’t have enough time to determine if this figure is spot on, but apparently it’s what the average driver gets. 5 That’s roughly 7 hours normal highway driving for me, although it might only be four and a half hours if you’re doing 130 on a Northern Territory highway.  In 15 years I’ve only taken my Hyundai Getz on two trips where that involved driving more than 7 hours a day.  And sitting behind the wheel that long is not something I recommend.  Over seven hours is too long on the road for a single driver.\nBut if you do want to drive more than 560 or so kilometers, Tesla has you covered.  Or they do in the majority of places people actually want to go.  This is because they have installed a heap of electric car chargers around the place that come in two main types:\nDestination Chargers:  These can take over an hour to provide 100 km range.\nSuperchargers:  These can take less than a dozen minutes to provide 100 km of range.\nTesla is also bringing out ultrachargers that are even faster than superchargers.  There is also a third type of slow Tesla charger, which I’ll tell you about it in a bit.\nDestination Chargers\nHere is the Destination Charger I briefly used at the Fox Winery:\nThe Fox Winery Tesla Destination Charger.  I was surprised when they told me it received a fair bit of use.\nAnd here is the Tesla Model S display showing the car charging from it:\nIf shows the destination charger would provide 93 kilometers of range per hour of charging.  It would take hours to fully charge a mostly flat battery pack, but for topping up while relaxing it’s very convenient.  The exact rate will depend on how much charge is already in the battery.  Like a mobile phone it will be moderately faster when nearly empty and moderately slower when nearly full.\nNote:  You need to check your charging cable is pushed all the way in.  I discovered power can flow at lower rate when it isn’t.  I doubt it was dangerous, but the fact this is possible in the Model S surprised me.\nThe location of Destination Chargers can be found online.  There’s a considerable number scattered around.  There wasn’t one shown online for the McCracken Country Club 6 where I spent Sunday night, so I was surprised to see what looked like one as I drove up.  I plugged the Tesla in and came back when I thought it would be nearly fully charged.  The car told me there were still nine and a half hours to go.\nThe reason why it wasn’t listed online was obviously because it’s not fast enough.  The lesson is — just because it looks like a destination charger, it isn’t necessarily one.  But if you are staying overnight a slow charger like this is likely to be all you need.  The wonderful receptionist there told me she’d never seen anyone else use it before, so get your Tesla down to the Country Club and goddamn stay there for at least nine hours. 7\nTesla Destination Chargers and slow chargers are free to use.  Tesla will pay for their installation but the location pays for the electricity.  This is fine for businesses trying to attract customers, but I do wonder about the morality of Councils installing them, since most Tesla drivers are rich and shouldn’t need to be subsidized by common folk.  But, given the harm vehicle pollution causes, it may be worthwhile.  And when you get down to it, isn’t that what society is all about?  Bribing the rich not to hurt us?\nTesla Supercharging\nHere is the Tesla Model S connected to the Supercharger in the centre of Adelaide:\nAnd here is the display showing it charging furiously:\nThe Supercharger is zapping the Tesla full of 510 km worth of range every hour.  In under 12 minutes it will be able to drive an additional 100 km.\nThere aren’t a huge number of superchargers in Australia at the moment, but there are enough so you can exclusively use them to drive from Adelaide to the Sunshine coast north of Brisbane.  Generally, you will have to pay to use them, but I didn’t bother to look into the costs because I figure if you can afford a Tesla you can bloody well afford the supercharger fees.\nCharging In a Pinch\nIf you have the right connector you can charge the Model S at any public electric car charger, although you’ll also need the right app or credit card or whatever they require.  You can also charge from a normal power point or a 15 amp socket such as those found in caravan parks.  Note you’ll only get about 12 kilometers of range per hour from a normal power point.\nProblem Solved\nYou could still claim a Supercharger isn’t nearly as good as a petrol pump that can slosh a car full of 500 km of range in just minutes.  But, overall, most people will spend less time fueling a Tesla than a petrol or diesel car.  This is because when Finn gets home he just plugs in his home charger, which takes seconds, and it automatically tops up his car with surplus solar electricity.  The only time he ever has to do anything more is if he’s taking a long trip.  But a typical driver has to spend at least 10 minutes a week going to a service station, which comes to about 9 hours a year.  Finn will spend less than an hour annually plugging and unplugging his Tesla and then maybe a few more hours on long trips using a supercharger or topping up with a destination charger when he would be relaxing anyway.  So, when you add it all up, he’s coming out ahead on time.\nNote:  I’m not talking to the person who is going to turn up in the comments and tell us how charging an electric vehicle will never work for them because of their particular circumstances.  That’s fine!  They can buy a hybrid!  I’m talking about normal people.  The average person is going to spend less time charging an electric car than they currently spend putting petrol in their tank.\n“Master, how can I fuel your Tesla?  The holes are too small!” I couldn’t find where to put the petrol in Finn’s electric car. Luckily, I found a large empty space under the bonnet call a “frunk” which could hold plenty.\nComfort\nThe Tesla Model S is the worst car I have ever driven when it come to climbing in and out.  I was surprised.  It’s a large car, but it’s a lot easier to jump in and out of my little Hyundai Getz.  Someone like my father could never use a Tesla Model S on account of his bad back.  Not unless they make one that rises up off its wheels.\nBut this is a normal problem for sports cars.  They’re designed for movie stars and models, not massively overweight people like me. 8 If you want the stupid high speed that goes with low aerodynamic drag, then a low roof is a necessity.\nMy friend Sam is 190 cm (six foot three) and while he didn’t feel cramped, I’m not sure he would have fit if he was much taller.  Both of us had trouble getting the buckles of our seat belts in and his belly is considerably smaller than my own.  (Obviously, he hasn’t hasn’t developed his stomach muscles as much as I have.)\nOnce you’re actually in the car and buckled up it’s fine.  But I have to admit I’m not a great judge of comfort.  After all, I do find Finn’s taste in music to be bearable.\nI went to Victor Harbor. (How lucky were they that Victor’s last name just happened to be Harbor?) There’s an island you can walk to, so I had to explore it. It was in Encounter Bay so not exploring the island would be like not wanting to level up at all.\nBrakes?  Who Needs Brakes?\nNormally when you take your foot off the accelerator a car it will start to slow down.  When you take your foot off a Tesla’s accelerator it will slow considerably more.  This is intentional and makes driving easier because you only need to brake when something unexpected happens.  It’s also a little bit of a safety feature, as the car will already be de-accelerating in the time it takes to transfer your foot from the accelerator to the brake.  It may seem strange when you’re reading about it, but it all feels natural when you try it.\nI took this photo next to a plaque that said at this spot Matthew Flinders Frenched in 1802.\nA Big Display\nThe Tesla Model S has a large touchscreen that handles everything that isn’t vital.  This includes music, navigation, and a billion other things I didn’t bother checking.\nThis was the first time I had used car navigation with a screen large enough to actually see what was going on.  I had heard this can make your ability to navigate without it worse and it’s true.  The map rotates to the direction you’re traveling so north doesn’t stay at the top and this fried my ability to orientate myself.  Lately, I’ve been trying to use the North Queensland trick of always using a compass direction instead of left and right to improve my sense of direction and the car navigation system blew all that hard work away.\nThe Model S screen turns into a big rear view display when the car is put into reverse, which is very useful.  At first I had trouble believing what the screen showed me was “real”, but it didn’t take long to get used to it.\nWhen I was locked in Plato’s Cave I had trouble knowing if the shadows on the wall were real.  Mind you, Uncle Plato was a bit weird.  Other people called the shadows on the wall television.\nVoice Activation\nIf you hit a button on the steering wheel you can tell the car what to do, such as display navigation or play music.  For these two things it works pretty well, unless you go out of mobile phone reception range, in which case it understands English about as well as your deaf Croatian Aunt after she decides to make your life hell for not marrying a nice Croatian girl. 9\nPhotos these days have way too much subject matter.\nRobodriving\nFinn paid extra so his Tesla would have “Full Self Driving Capability”, which is named about as accurately as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It can’t self-drive and it will be the Department of Transport and Main Roads that decides if it will ever be allowed to do that, not Tesla.\nBut it’s still pretty funky.\nMy understanding is every Tesla Model S has cruise control, can steer itself to stay in its lane, and warns you if you come too close to an obstacle.\nIf you spent the extra $8,500 the package of lies costs, then — depending on whether or not it feels like it — the Tesla Model S can do automatic lane changes, park and unpark itself, and stop you from doing something stupid like sideswiping a truck. 10 In the future — according to Tesla —  it will be capable of driving itself.  But they’ve already been sued for lying about what it would be able to do, so don’t believe what Tesla tells you and understand that you’re just throwing the dice when you pay for this.\nI thought the Kaiki was a lie because it was as hard as rock, but it turns out it’s actually the name of the Island and not meant to be the Japanese pronunciation of the word “cake”.\nI tried the cruise control and the lane keeping and I gave up on them because they were just too stressful to use.  I was worried I’d stop paying attention to the road and have a prang.  In Japan they fully understand this problem and make their train drivers constantly do a little dance to keep them alert.  But there wasn’t much room for dancing in the Tesla Model S, so I was scared I’d space out.  I’m fine with the fact there are no gears to change, but cruise control and lane keeping seem to make it too easy to fall asleep at the wheel.  However, I know some people like these features and they’re not dead yet, so each to their own.\n“I watch the lightning crack over Rapid Bay, and laugh and think, this is Australia .”\nIt’s Oh So Quiet!\nWhen I first started driving the Tesla Model S, I didn’t realize how quiet it was because I was feeling super stressed about driving a $150,000 car.\nIt didn’t really sink in until I turned on the stereo and thought there was something wrong with the speakers.  It took me a while to figure it out, but I realized the problem was I could actually understand the lyrics to the song.  I had never been able to do this before with my usual driving music.  It turned out, much to my surprise, that at no point is Meatloaf saying…\n“Like a cattle bell I’ll be corn when the morning gongs.”\nI never realized Meatloaf was using language before.  I thought he just had some kind of musical word salad brain injury.\nBecause I have highly refined and sophisticated musical taste, I think it might be worth $10 an hour for me to be able to appreciate the more subtle aspects of music, such as lyrics, when driving.  If I drove an average of an hour a day then an electric car would provide me with around $3,652.50 a year in enhanced musical pleasure. 11 This is one aspect of electric vehicles I’ve never really considered.\nIt’s also a lot easier to have a conversation.  When I had passengers I could clearly hear everyone in the vehicle, including my  son in the backseat.  None of us were “autoshouting” which is the mode of communication we unconsciously slip into when inside an internal combustion engine car.\nIf the SA Tourism Board doesn’t send me a check I will be very upset.\nBest Tesla Model S Music\nHere are some of the best tracks to listen to in a Tesla Model S.  Finn might add a few of his own, but don’t trust him.  My picks are far superior:\n', 'TSLA',

State officials rushed through a $1.3 billion tax abatement package—the largest in Nevada’s history—to incentivize Tesla to move there. But when complications emerged from the influx of new workers, state and local governments were ill-prepared and had little financial resources to address them.\nFurther reading: This isn’t the first time safety issues have been reported at a Tesla factory.

Click here for Morning Brew’s privacy policy.\nBloomberg has conducted a survey of Tesla Model 3 owners and has been publishing the results in tranches.\nThe latest is called \"Market Evolution,\" which sounds impressive and cryptic, but is really just about how the Bloomberg demo — 95% male, 30-50 years old, financially well-off — is swapping its BMWs for Teslas. Crunching the trade-in numbers, Bloomberg concluded that BMW tops a \"vulnerability index\" relative to Tesla; that the other German carmaker, Mercedes-Benz, doesnt, falling at the bottom of the index.\n\"One explanation is that the two brands, while both competing in the same price segments, target different definitions of luxury,\" Bloombergs Tom Randall, Dean Halford and Cedric Sam opined.\n\"Mercedes is built for comfort and class, while BMW is defined by its driving performance. Comfort and class are hard to measure; for performance, you take the car to the track.\"\nYeesh. The percentage of BMWs that ever get anywhere near a track is minuscule. The truth is that BMW owners and leasers skew smack into that male, 35-50 demo, while Mercedes customers are older.\nMushy-headed reasoning and a survey of owners who can afford just about anything\nThe BMW 3-Series.\nBMW\nThe mushy-headed reasoning doesnt end there. The Model 3 isnt a cheap car — Bloomberg notes an average price of more than $50,000. Thats not even entry-level luxury, its mid-luxury, and a strong indication that the current crop of Model 3 owners isnt terribly price-sensitive. On a five-year loan, thats a $900 monthly payment — roughly $400 more than what the average American is shelling out (and thats average — most owners want a number thats significantly lower).\nThe bottom line is that Model 3 owners can pretty much buy or lease whatever they want. OK, maybe not Ferraris and Bentleys. But they can choose between a modest monthly payment on a Mazda or a steeper one on a Model 3, absorbing the Tesla premium without stressing their household finances.\nLets move on to the larger question of whether BMW has a Tesla problem.\nThe answer is that BMW doesnt have a Tesla problem. BMWs average transaction price in the US is well north of $50,000, and the carmaker sells a variety of models in multiple segments. The overall business globally generates one of the highest profit margins in the industry for a carmaker at its volumes, about 10% annually.\nLike many automakers, BMW has seen customers shift away from sedans like the 3-, 5-, and 7-Series to SUVs such as the X5 and X7, but thats a positive development for the bottom line, as premium SUVs have higher margins.\nIn the US, BMW has also nurtured a stable market share since 2013 of about 2%, selling between 300-350,000 vehicles every year. It operates one factory in the US (in South Carolina, since 1994) with a capacity of nearly 500,000 vehicles annually, all of the SUVs.\nThe upshot here is that BMWs business has been designed to fit with its markets and to generate a predictable profit on predictable investment.\nTeslas numerous business challenges\nTesla CEO Elon Musk.\nREUTERS/Mike Blake\nTesla, meanwhile, has pushed toward the same level of sales — 250,000 units in 2018, perhaps 350,000 in 2019 — but hasnt come anywhere near an annual profit. Its not actually clear that its car business can convert an entirely speculative gross margin thats usually stated as being between 20-30% into a net margin. Beyond that, Tesla is effectively selling one new car, the Model 3; the higher-ticket Model S and Model X dont look as though theyre going to be revamped.\nObjectively, with BMW you have a very good business, and with Tesla, you have a pretty bad one. Teslas saving grace has been that there is an appetite for all-electric cars in the US and elsewhere, so revenue generation had been drastically improving for the company quarter-to-quarter.\nBut in order to sell more Model 3s, Tesla has had to ding revenue by cutting prices. Thats caused revenue growth to flatline in 2019. And with eroding deliveries in the segments filled by the aging Model S and Model X, Tesla isnt getting it back on its more expensive offerings.\nTesla has achieved what few thought was possible: create a new car brand — and power it with electricity! But few thought it was possible for a reason: the economics of volume manufacturing are extremely challenging. If Tesla didnt have access to optimistic investors seeking financial growth — the stock is up over 1,000% since its 2010 IPO — the company would have run out of money years ago.\nTesla is obviously emerging as a luxury competitor and could encourage BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, and Audi to increase their electrification efforts. But it isnt evident that the electric market could be steadily profitable, and because its still small — only about 2% of global sales — even Teslas popularity is unlikely to convince BMW and others that they need to undertake the truly massive spending theyd need to fight for tenths of points of share.\nThe same old Tesla mistakes\nTeslas factory.\nTesla\nAgain and again, Tesla observers make this fundamental error. Meanwhile, in the industry, Tesla has been welcomed as a competitor, for two reasons.\nFirst, Tesla investors are funding all the risk. BMW, for one, doesnt have to spend anything to create new EV buyers. Its often argued that Tesla spends nothing on advertising and therefore has some sort of leg up on the incumbents, but this overlooks that Tesla has lost $6 billion to simply exist. Had Teslas investors not been willing to shoulder this, then Bloomberg wouldnt have any Model 3 owners to survey.\nSecond, Teslas success indicates that there could be growth in EVs (outside of China and a part of Europe, Im skeptical). If Tesla doubles sales, then the market could also double, and if thats sustainable, then eventually big carmakers could see some competitive logic. All boats rise.\nThe important thing to remember about the auto industry is that there are no winners and losers — there are only winners. If you lose, you disappear. Otherwise, the business is defined by competition, up to a point. Nobody is willing to compete themselves out of business.\nExcept, perhaps, for Tesla. If Im BMW, I could easily look at the Bloomberg survey and conclude that with the Model 3, Tesla is solving my sedan problem in the US. Sedans are increasingly unpopular. And yet, BMW has a stalwart franchise in the 3-Series. Still, I might prefer to sell people X3 and X5 SUVs. Tesla provides me with my excuse.\nThink about that the next time you see a headline that reads \"Model 3 Success Hits BMW the Hardest.\"\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

Towing a car behind a big burly pickup truck can somehow save fuel? Next Ill tell you that putting these pellets in your gas tank will make your car get 100 mpg.\nBut its true. If youve got a dead-empty last-generation Ford F-150 Raptor with the 6.2-liter V-8, and a dead-empty Tesla Model 3, and one single gallon of gas, youll go farther by using the Raptor to tow-charge the Tesla—then driving the Tesla as far as you can—than you would just driving the Raptor.\nAt least, thats what Jason Fenske says. Fenske, host of the fantastic YouTube channel Engineering Explained , put this theory to the test by partnering up with the guys from The Straight Pipes , bringing his Tesla and their Raptor together at Toronto Motorsports Park for a test of thermodynamics in action.\nThe results are pretty fascinating. Using one single gallon of gas, the Raptor was able to cover a mere 10.7 miles in Fenskes testing. Under the same conditions, the Tesla could go 108.5 miles on an amount of electric energy equal to a gallon of gas.\nBut when they strapped the Tesla to the Raptor and tugged it along, something unexpected happen. Thanks to the Teslas passive regenerative braking to recharge the battery (meaning the amount of regen available when coasting, not while riding the brake pedal), dragging the EV behind the Raptor for as long as it took to go through one gallon of gas added 18.1 miles of battery range to the Tesla. And thats not including the 3.4 miles covered by the truck. In other words, to get the most out of that one gallon of gas, you could tow the Tesla 3.4 miles, then hop in the Model 3 and drive an additional 18.1 miles, for a total of 21.5 miles from a single gallon.\nAnd no, this doesnt violate the laws of physics. Youre not \"creating energy\"—the 18.1 miles of range generated by tow-charging the Tesla is far less than the 108.5 miles youd get if you could turn a gallon of gas directly into battery charge with no energy loss. It boils down to this: The Tesla is far more aerodynamic, and far lighter, than the Ford pickup, so using the Ford to transfer energy to the Tesla is still more efficient than just driving the Ford.\nHeres a bizarre internal-combustion analogy. Say that, instead of the Raptor and the Tesla, you had a Raptor and a Mitsubishi Mirage, rated at 43 mpg highway. If you had a single gallon of fuel in the Raptors tank, and you wanted to go as far as possible on that gallon, youd siphon it out of the Ford and put it in the much more efficient Mitsubishi. Even if you spilled half of it in the process, youd still be able to go about 21.5 miles with the Mirage—much further than you could with the Raptor.\nIf all of this is making your head spin, check out Fenskes full video below. Its chock-full of math, but as always with Fenske, its easy to follow and entertaining as hell. And yes, the answer is clear: You can save fuel by using your Raptor to tow a Tesla.

If not, it can cost $1800 or more.\nFlash memory devices, while compact and resilient, are not failure-proof. When failure happens to the memory chip inside any vehicle, the problems can be massive. It seems that the type of flash memory that Tesla used in some older Model S and Model X vehicles has had data written and rewritten to it enough times that the devices are causing problems with the cars themselves, specifically with the central display screen and ability to charge.\nA quick glance at social media and YouTube reveals the problem is relatively widespread. This is not a surprise, since the type of memory chips that Tesla is using in its electric vehicles are only meant to be rewritten tens of thousands of times. With the amount of data that the flash devices—technically called embedded Multi-Media Controllers, or eMMCs—process in a Tesla vehicle, those tens of thousands of times eventually get used up, especially as Teslas firmware image size has grown from around 300 MB to around 1 GB. All of this processing means that its only a matter of time until most of these EVs start to suffer.\nAccording to Rich Rebuilds , a vehicle repair channel on YouTube, Tesla changed the eMMCs used in its vehicles in 2018, but InsideEVs says that the second version of the eMMCs will also fail, eventually.\nThis content is imported from twitter.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk did say on Twitter in mid-October that things \"should be much better at this point,\" but he did not specify if this means that the newer chips can handle more rewriting or if Tesla has somehow changed the code so it does not generate as many rewrites or something else. Tesla did not respond to Car and Drivers multiple requests for comment on this matter.\nIf a Model S or X is under warranty, then Tesla will replace the entire media control unit (MCU)—the motherboard that contains the eMMC—for free in case of a failure. But if the car is out of warranty, then it could cost a Tesla owner somewhere between $1800 and $3000 (estimates vary) to get a new MCU. But even so, this just sort of resets the timeline for when the rewrite limit is reached.\nOne repair shop told InsideEVs that theres no reason for Tesla to have programmed its vehicles to rewrite all of this data to the eMMCs. \"There are absolutely zero reasons to log hundreds of MB per day to a small built-in flash chip,\" Tesla expert Jason Hughes said.\nSebastian Blanco\nContributing Editor\nSebastian Blanco has been writing about electric vehicles, hybrids, and hydrogen cars since 2006.

If we convert all 25 million barrels a day overnight to electric vehicles, we’re still going to need a lot of hydrocarbons.”\nBy 2040 more than half of new car sales will be electric vehicles , according to forecasts. But it will take a much longer time before they make up half of cars on the road, as gasoline powered cars slowly wear out and are scrapped.\nMuch of the world’s expanding population is in parts of the world where electric vehicles will have trouble taking hold, Sheffield said.\n“In Africa, where a lot of that growth is, they can’t go immediately to electric vehicles. They just don’t have the infrastructure. It will take a long time for EVs to replace the gasoline engine in my opinion,” he said.\nBeyond that, much of the electricity that will be used to recharge electric vehicles in the future will come from natural gas being produced by the US industry.\n“In the Permian, 40% of our production is natural gas,” said Sheffield. “Natural gas will continue to capture [electricity generation] market share.”\nMuch of the growth of natural gas used to generate electricity is due to fracking, which has driven down the cost of gas.\nSheffield’s lack of concern about the growth of electric vehicles is echoed by others in the industry.\n“When folks talk about energy transitions, these are significant shifts that will take a long period of time,” said Frank Macchiarola, vice president of downstream and industry operations at the American Petroleum Institute, the trade group for both the oil and natural gas industries.\nMacchiarola questions whether electric vehicle adoption will take place at the pace of some of the current forecasts. And he agrees that much of the electricity that will be used to charge any electric vehicles will come from natural gas.\n“Based on independent analysis, two things are clear,” he said. “One: Natural gas will be a significant source of power generation in the United States. Two: Oil will continue to be used a primary source of transportation fuel,” he said.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-14'),

Some lamented at the time that we didn’t have enough deal-closing funds, and sharply criticized lawmakers for not calling a special session to approve them.\nALLHANDS: How smart are data centers for Arizona?\nThe lesson is not that we should turn away thousands of tech jobs.\nBut we need to recognize that even good growth comes with costs that someone will have to pay. Offering massive incentives only makes that worse.\nAnd if we continue to let problems simmer – like the chronic lack of transportation funds to keep traffic at bay, or the growing lack of affordable housing – what has happened in places like Reno will come home to roost in metro Phoenix.\nWe are not immune.\nReach Allhands at joanna.allhands@arizonarepublic.com .

Bigger wheels cost more and ride rougher than their downsized counterparts, two sacrifices we commonly note. What we usually dont point out is the other penalty: cars with big wheels are less efficient.\nUpdate, November 15: This article was originally posted on November 8, 2019, at 4:24pm. On the morning of November 15, the EPA contacted R&T to correct erroneous MPGe ratings the agency had previously provided for the Model 3 Performance on 18-inch wheels. Previously, that car was rated at 128 MPGe city, 120 highway, 124 combined; the updated figures provided by the EPA are 124 MPGe city, 116 highway, 121 combined. The overall battery range of 322 miles was unchanged, and there were no changes to any other models. We have corrected the numbers below.\nThats clear if youve looked at Teslas official EPA figures for the 2020 Model 3 Performance , which were first brought to our attention by InsideEVs . According to the figures, a Model 3 Performance on standard 18-inch wheels can drive up to 322 miles on a charge, achieving 124 MPGe in the EPAs combined cycle.\nEPA\nUpgrade to the 20-inch wheels and your maximum EPA-estimated range drops by 23 miles, to 299 miles per change. The bigger wheels bring a significant reduction in efficiency, dropping the official rating of the Model 3 Performance down to 113 MPGe combined. If you opt for the mid-tier, 19-inch wheels, the EPA says to expect 304 miles of range and 116 MPGe.\nThe EPA numbers show similar range penalties for upsized wheels on the Performance versions of the Model S and Model X . The Model X loses 33 miles of range if you opt for 22-inch wheels over the standard 20s, while a 21-inch-equipped Model S Performance sacrifices 22 miles of range compared to the standard 19-inch wheels. Strangely, the EPA does not break out range and MPGe ratings by wheel size on non-Performance Tesla models.\nThe 2019 Model 3 Performance, we should note, was only available with 20-inch wheels. It was rated by the EPA at 116 MPGe and a 310-mile range, both better figures than the EPA expects from the 2020 Model 3 Performance on 20-inch wheels. Thats an outlier, as the rest of the Model 3 lineup (Standard Range and Long Range) got more efficient for 2020 in EPA ratings.\nAnd currently, on Teslas website, you can only configure a Model 3 Performance with 20-inch wheels—the standard 18-inch wheels are greyed-out and not clickable on the page, and the 20s are included in the price of the Performance package.\nThe color and wheel option page for the Tesla Model 3 Performance, showing that only 20-inch wheels are available on that model\nTesla.com\nTesla has not confirmed whether 18- or 19-inch wheels will be available on the 2020 Model 3 Performance, though these EPA ratings suggest that its happening.

Very cool.\nThe all-electric carmaker started out cool, with its original Roadster , proving that EVs could be more that souped-up golf carts. Teslas cool culminated in a raucous, rock-n-roll spectacular at its semi-truck reveal in late 2017, when to the pulsating thrum of the Beastie Boys \"Sabotage,\" CEO Elon Musk staged the greatest \"Just one more thing\" moment in high-tech history and rolled out the new Roadster, to a crowd that went completely bonkers.\nIts been downhill since then, with the company mired in the plug-and-chug manufacturing of its Model 3 sedan. Making matters worse has been the arrival of the Porsche Taycan, which in proper German-car fashion became the fastest production EV to lap the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife track. More recently, the Taycan has outrun the top-speed Tesla Model S set in some quarter-mile drag races.\nMusk and Tesla said that the Model S would take to the Nürburgring (something the carmaker has never officially done) to prove that its four-door is faster around the 13-mile \"Green Hell.\" That hasnt happened yet (there have been some unofficial times), and while weve been waiting, Top Gear\" pitted the Taycan and Model S against each other in a showdown .\n\"Top Gear\" found the vehicles compelling for different reasons, liking the Model S for its versatility and the Porsche for, ahem, being a Porsche.\nThat didnt stop Musk from complaining about the drag-race results, and to be fair, he and Tesla have a fraught past with \"Top Gear,\" dating to the period when the show was cohosted by Jeremy Clarkson and was vocally unfriendly to EVs.\nNothing is less interesting than a fight about Nürburgring times\nThe Nürburgring isnt cool, Elon.\nGetty Images\nThe issue here is that all that gearhead-y feuding is utterly uncool. It was always uncool; nothing is less interesting than young men (its mostly young men) with too much time on their hands blabbering about Nürburgring times. Even people who love Porsches (Im one of them) dont care much about Nürburgring times. Even the word \"Nürburgring,\" in this context, makes me cringe.\nDrag-race times are even worse. Drag-racing is cool under exactly three conditions: when its between a pair of screamin top-fuel dragsters at an NHRA event in California; when it involves James Dean (and even then, its a tragic cool ); or when ... actually, there arent three times when its cool. Top-fuel and James Dean is all Ive got. OK, Ill give you funny car, but just because Im not a total curmudgeon.\nTeslas mission is supposed to be to accelerate the worlds freedom from fossil fuels. Not duke it out deep in the furrows of online uncool with people who give a hoot about the NUR-BURG-RING and straight-ahead speed on uncluttered asphalt.\nBetter than the best — but stay cool, please\nThe Model 3 is plenty fast.\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nYeah, I get it: Tesla wants to brand itself as not just as good as the great names of motoring but better. And faster is better, even though Tesla has avoided any sort of factory supported participation in motorsports. In many ways, Teslas entire identity is based on speed, so when its achievements in speed are challenged, it has to rise to the fight.\nOr does it? Teslas bread-and-butter now is the Model 3, and while thats a zippy set of wheels, it hardly presents a road-scorching profile. Its a four-door, for cryin out loud! (In fairness, Tesla has offered a Track Mode upgrade .)\nBesides, the whole point is sustainable mobility, an admirable goal and a key reason why Tesla has the market cap of a Ford or GM rather than a boutique maker of neurotic Nürburgring conquerors. That Tesla was moving past speed was, in my view, a good sign.\nThat its been dragged back in, in my view — isnt.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

The images provide the first close-up glimpse of the locally-made electric sedan, including some design elements that are not present in its US-made counterparts.\nContrary to Tesla’s US-made Model 3s, the vehicles that are being produced at Gigafactory 3 will feature two unique badges at the rear. On the left side of the vehicle are Chinese characters that reference “Tesla,” and on the right are the words “Model 3″ in English. Tesla showed off two vehicles in its teaser photos, both of which are painted blue and fitted with 18” Aero Wheels.\nTesla’s Made-in-China Model 3.

This allows Model 3 owners to charge their vehicles on the country’s growing EV charging infrastructure.\nTesla China’s release of the Made-in-China Model 3’s initial pictures follows the company’s latest teaser for the vehicle, which suggested that the locally-produced all-electric sedan will be available soon. Together with this teaser were speculations that Tesla will be holding an event for the Made-in-China Model 3 on November 11, which also happens to be the country’s Singles’ Day, a massive shopping event that consistently dwarfs the US’ Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nTesla’s Made-in-China Model 3.

(Credit: JayInShanghai /Twitter)\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, who is currently in China, has noted that Gigafactory 3 is only waiting for its final approvals to begin manufacturing the Made-in-China Model 3. Once the final approvals are acquired, the Shanghai-based facility could start producing the all-electric sedan for the local market. Elon Musk has previously estimated that Gigafactory 3’s Model 3 production could start at a rate of 1,000 units per week, though recent comments by Tesla Global VP Grace Tao have suggested that the company is looking to hit a more ambitious rate of 3,000 vehicles per week.\nGigafactory 3 stands as a key component of Tesla’s strategy in China. With the facility in place, the electric car maker would be able to compete in the country’s local EV market , which currently stands as the largest in the world. Tesla’s previous vehicles such as the Model S and Model X are well-loved, but their premium base price and import tariffs make them out of reach for many EV buyers. The Model 3 will be a different story, particularly as Gigafactory 3 will exclusively produce affordable versions of the sedan for China.\nFirst look at Tesla’s Made-in-China Model 3\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-07'),

Alexander DemianchukTASS via Getty Images\nNew York City cabs are going electric. As first reported by Electrek , the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has added the Tesla Model 3 to its list of approved vehicles for the city’s fleet of taxis. New York allows almost 40 different makes and models of vehicles to be used as yellow cabs, but the Model 3 is the first fully electric vehicle to become a permanent part of the fleet.\nThis is not the first time New York has tried to electrify the fleet. The TLC previously used Nissan Leaf vehicles as part of an experimental program, but it concluded that drivers had to drastically alter their driving habits and discontinued its use in 2015 based on those needs.\nSEE ALSO: Here Are the Best and Worst Colors of Tesla Cars to Own\nIn order for a vehicle to be approved for taxi use , a car must have air conditioning for rear seat passengers. The car must also have enough space to install the clear partition that separates the passengers in the backseat from the driver. The Nissan Leaf is no longer on the city’s approved vehicles list.\nThis time, however, could be different: the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 is larger and has a longer range than the Leaf (220 miles as opposed to the Leaf’s 84-mile range). Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has been pushing for the Model 3 to become part of taxi fleets. In April, he announced plans to launch an autonomous Tesla taxi service by 2020, touting that the range and battery life of a Tesla Model 3 make it a quality alternative to cab drivers.\nAdding Tesla to the taxi fleet comes alongside new blossoming priorities for sustainable transit options in New York. In September, the MTA board approved a $51.5 billion capital spending plan that includes 500 new zero-emission, all-electric buses.\nNew York City is the second American city to add fully electric cars to its fleet. In Columbus, Ohio  the local cab company wants to convert its entire fleet to be carbon neutral. The Columbus Ohio Yellow Cab fleet is comprised of 170 cars, and 20 of them are now electric.\nAnd similarly to New York City, the Central Ohio Transit Authority plans to add at least 10 electric buses to its fleet by 2021. Now, taxis can compete with Uber and Lyft , appealing to environmentally conscious consumers starting in New York and Columbus but could soon spur to other cities.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-15'),

Thats more than double from 31% of vehicles for the 2014 model year.\n\"Its becoming ubiquitous,\" said Karl Brauer, Cox Automotive executive publisher. \"Its basically, youre not going to have a hard key that gets turned physically to start a car soon. Itll just all be gone.\"\nSuch systems are more convenient because people dont have to remove keys from their pockets or bags. Theyre also considered safer because there are no keys that could shift out of \"run\" while the vehicle is in motion, a situation found to have contributed to more than 100 deaths as part of General Motors ignition switch crisis in 2014 .\nSmartphone keys\nAdding to the demise of the traditional car keys is the rise of automakers such as Tesla and Lincoln allowing drivers to use their smartphones as car keys to enter and drive their vehicles.\nGM\nand other automakers have allowed owners to control certain features of a vehicle such as remote start and locking or unlocking from their smartphones for years. The Tesla Model 3 was the first to allow owners to use their smartphones as a key to drive the vehicle.\n\"Peoples phones have basically become a fifth limb now,\" Brauer said. \"I like the idea of a phone-related system. Your phone has a whole lot more value to you and youre going to be much more prone to track it and make sure you dont forget it or lose it.\"\nLincoln this fall is launching a similar feature called \"Phone as a Key\" that allows smartphones to be set up as car keys. The system, which was announced last year, uses Bluetooth or the vehicles onboard Wi-Fi to communicate with the smartphone.\n\"It is about making it more effortless and not having to remember where your keys are at,\" Lincoln President Joy Falotico told CNBC. \"But we want to do it in a way that takes it a step further with all this personalization that makes it easier to use.\"\nLincoln debuted its \"Phone as a Key\" technology on the Aviator crossover, allowing clients to lock and unlock the vehicle, open its trunk and start and drive it – without a key fob.\nLincoln\nFalotico described the feature as a \"natural extension\" to its customer profiles that allow the Ford Motor luxury brand to better tailor dozens of infotainment settings and interior cabin preferences such as climate, audio and seating to individual drivers.\nLincoln, according to Falotico, plans to evaluate its lineup and expand the technology \"where it makes sense.\" Phone as a Key is scheduled to debut this fall on the 2020 Lincoln Aviator and Corsair crossovers and 2020 Lincoln Navigator.\n\"For consumers, theres a big convenience factor switching from traditional mechanical keys to some sort of wireless digital key,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Navigant Research.\nTech concerns\nLike most new technologies, phone-based systems come with their own set of problems: What if the phone dies or gets lost? What if a driver needs to valet the vehicle? Or what if the system doesnt function as designed?\nFor such situations, Tesla provides Model 3 owners with a backup keycard and Lincoln continues to provide owners with a standard key fob.\nKeyless cars also mean automakers and smartphone providers will need to work much more closely to ensure their systems communicate effectively with one another, according to Consumer Reports.\n\"Theres also an issue with the smartphone itself: The lifespan of a car is far longer than that of any smartphone, so suppliers will have to work with phone manufacturers to ensure that their virtual-key technology remains compatible over the years,\" wrote the consumer watchdog publication.\nConsumer Reports last year reported testers occasionally had problems with Teslas app-based key system , including being \"unable to open the Model 3s door when they had closed the app — the modern equivalent of fumbling for keys at the bottom of a purse.\"\nDigital keys combined with updated technology to allow for faster access are expected to assist in overcoming such problems.\nShared mobility\nKeyless cars also better enable emerging vehicle ownership models such as subscription services and shared mobility businesses, including autonomous vehicles.\nGMs Maven car-sharing service has been keyless through an app since it began in 2016, although the company hasnt extended that to owners being able to drive their vehicles with a smartphone.\n\"It makes a lot of sense because whether or not the car is autonomous and it comes to your door, the idea that It is keyless … is going to have to happen,\" Edmunds Caldwell said. \"Its not just about convenience, its about your own personal safety.\"\nCustomers of GMs maven car sharing program use an app enable remote functions such as starting, heating or cooling and driving of the vehicles.\nUsing a digital key with a profile connected could assist emergency units and others in gathering information about who was driving the vehicle in the case of emergency, according to Caldwell. It would allow them to prep for the person ahead of time for a myriad of things such as blood type and allergies.\nThe speed of keyless technology, according to Abuelsamid, also is expected to increase. Currently, it can take seconds or more for a vehicle to respond to remote commands from a smartphone. However, automakers such as Volkswagen are scheduled to release vehicles with \"ultra-wideband\" connections instead of Bluetooth that can communicate and respond in milliseconds.\n\"Youre going to start seeing more of this ultra-wideband technology be used in vehicles going forward,\" he said. \"It can send a lot more messages back and forth between the transmitter and receiver.\"\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-09'),

The racks are so heavy it takes a team of four people to maneuver them.\nNevada Gigafactory: Take a tour inside Teslas facility, from battery cells to drive trains\nTesla has allowed tours of Nevadas Gigafactory 1 in the past to media and officials, but a comprehensive safety inspection still has not occurred.\nBenjamin Spillman, Reno Gazette Journal\nUnfortunately for Dillon, he was the guy holding the bottom of the rack. He was still pulling his hand out when the team dropped it.\n“When it hit my finger and I pulled it out, I knew,” he said. “I was like ‘OK, somethings not there anymore.’”\nHe was wearing gloves, so he couldn’t immediately see that the rack had smashed off the top inch of his right index finger.\nDillon is now a 24-year-old grad student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\nIt’s impossible to tell whether Dillon’s injury could have been avoided because the company never reported it to workplace safety inspectors as required by state and federal law.\nBut other challenging impacts of the company’s rapid growth are clear.\nListen to The City, Season 2\nHow far will a city go to shed its reputation? Find out in an investigative podcast from USA TODAY.\nSubscribe to the podcast\nFrom straining local emergency responders, to exacerbating the region’s critical housing shortage and taxing area roads, Tesla has brought a host of complications to the region. State and local governments were ill-prepared for those consequences and, because of the tax abatements, had limited financial resources to address them, according to a months-long examination by USA TODAY’s investigative podcast, The City .\nIt all began in 2014, when Nevada won a fierce competition among states for Tesla’s ambitious battery factory project.\nTesla had promised states it would construct a factory bigger than any building in the world, employ thousands of people and generate at least $5 billion in capital investment. To score the project, local officials promised lightning fast construction permits and state lawmakers rushed through the largest tax abatement package in state history, worth $1.3 billion .\nTesla, and its partner Panasonic, built the factory at a furious pace, putting it into production even as construction continued. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised investors the company would be making 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of 2017. The Gigafactory was key to that goal.\nAnd it ramped up fast. Employment at the factory jumped from 24 people in 2015 to 3,200 by the end of 2017 and double that by the end of 2018. Today more than 7,000 people work there.\nThe undertaking dwarfed anything Northern Nevada had seen before.\nInside the famed factory\nMusk hasn’t yet delivered on his promise to build the world’s largest building in the Nevada desert. But at 30% completion, the Gigafactory is already a monolith.\nTucked into the burnt-brown hillsides of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center about 20 miles east of Reno, the building is a half-mile long and nearly a quarter-mile wide at its widest point.\nGetting into the secretive factory isn’t easy. Guards at an entrance station stop anyone without authorization from going farther. As construction was underway, Tesla bought up thousands of acres around the factory, in part to protect it from looky-loos.\nAlthough Tesla has begun giving community tours in the past year or so, it took weeks of  discussion before USA TODAY was allowed in.\nInside, the factory is overwhelming to the senses: giant robot arms swing through the air, driverless forklifts hum and honk around the work sites, workers rush to their stations to keep up with demanding goals.\nThe building is so cavernous that even the tour guides got lost showing reporters around. Tesla’s vice president for operations, Chris Lister said he puts in more than 10,000 steps a day. A bathroom break can require a 20-minute round trip trek.\nEverything is on a gargantuan scale. It took more than 8,000 construction workers to build the factory. The more than 7,000 people who work there now churn out millions of battery cells a week.\nThe Nevada factory is Tesla’s first Gigafactory. A second one is under construction in China and the company is still looking for a site for a third in Europe. As the first, the Nevada Gigafactory is a test kitchen of sorts.\n“The thing about the Gigafactory 1, is it was really an experiment in, how can we make things as efficient as possible?” Lister said. “And you know, Gigafactory 10, lets say, is gonna be 10 times better than Gigafactory 1 from all of the learnings that we capture as we go on.”\nAll of that experimentation – designing manufacturing lines as they were put into production, for instance, and constructing the building at the same time it was up and running as a factory – also created a particularly chaotic environment, according to interviews and public documents.\n‘We are requesting EMS’\nGetting a full accounting of workplace injuries is difficult. Federal law doesn’t require site-specific injury totals to be reported publicly.\nDocuments obtained by USA TODAY, including 911 calls and inspection reports from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, show injuries at the Gigafactory near Reno occur on a routine basis: at least three a month.\nTesla has had documented safety problems at its factory in Fremont, California. Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found Tesla underreported its injuries, failed to properly train its workers and even avoided recommended safety markings because Musk reportedly doesn’t like the color yellow. Forbes also found the Fremont factory had racked up more fines and workplace safety violations than other car manufacturing plants.\nAs was the case in Fremont, the Gigafactory has created substantial work for the state’s OSHA office. Inspectors were on-site at Tesla more than 90 times in its first three years of operation. On average, other factories in the area saw an inspector once in the same time period.\nWatch: A birds eye view of the Tesla Gigafactory\nNevada won the Tesla Gigafactory by offering streamlined permits and significant tax breaks.\nJason Bean, Reno Gazette Journal\nSince 2017, Tesla has been fined $26,900 for workplace safety violations at the Gigafactory but has succeeded in getting almost all of the fines reduced or eliminated. Three of the four fines involved amputations.\nEven OSHA doesn’t have a complete inventory of workplace injuries. Dillon’s injury, for example, was never reported to the agency, even though he suffered an amputation and was hospitalized. State and federal law requires a report for all amputations and injuries that require hospitalization.\nThe factory is also the source of a flood of 911 emergency calls. In 2018, someone called 911 from the Gigafactory more than once a day, on average, for things like fights, suicide attempts, DUIs, thefts and drug overdoses .\nListen: Hear some of the 911 calls to the Gigafactory in Episode 4 of The City\nA quarter of those 911 calls were for medical concerns, like heart problems, difficulty breathing, seizures and pregnancy issues. Those calls also included workplace injuries: finger amputations like Dillon’s, an electrocution, head injuries from unsecured construction debris blowing off the roof in a windstorm, people falling through holes in the floor.\nEmergency response to the factory is difficult because of its size and severe communication problems hamper getting critical information to dispatchers in a timely manner.\nDuring a chemical spill in 2017, for example, firefighters were met with “quite a bit of resistance” from Tesla managers, according to the incident report. Tesla supervisors couldn’t immediately provide the name of the chemical that spilled, or help firefighters account for people who should’ve been evacuated from the building. Workers ignored caution tape meant to keep them out of contaminated areas.\nTwelve people were treated and released from the hospital. They had been exposed to carbonic acid, a byproduct of the battery production process that causes respiratory issues and skin and eye irritation. No one suffered serious injury.\nNone of that surprised Chad Dehne, who worked at the Gigafactory for several months supervising teams of temp workers who inspect battery canisters. He was there during a similar incident in 2018.\nWhen a call came in to evacuate, Dehne said workers scattered. No one seemed to be in charge of making sure everyone made it out safely, he said. As a supervisor, he used his own homemade sign-in sheets to find all of his workers on duty that day.\n“Come to find out there was two people that were still inside the building,” he said. “I went inside. ... They were in there working! And being exposed. These guys said ‘Evacuate the building,’ and just beat feet. And not one person was responsible for going in there to make sure that everybody was gone.”\nBecause of the tax abatements granted by state lawmakers, Tesla can operate essentially tax free in Nevada for 10 years and with a substantially reduced tax bill for another decade. Since 2017, Storey County, home to the Gigafactory, has lost out on $65 million in tax revenue.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, left, and former Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval shake hands following the 2014 announcement that the carmaker would build its $5 billion Gigafactory outside Reno. Cathleen Allison, AP Photo\nIn other words, Tesla’s not helping pay for the increase in government services it’s using.\nTake the Storey County Fire District, which is responsible for responding to all of those calls for emergency medical service. Last year, firefighters responded 104 times to 1 Electric Avenue, home of the Gigafactory.\nThe fire chief had to open and staff a new fire station to respond to the increased demand.\nOn one hand, Chief Jeff Nevin downplayed the impact the Gigafactory’s arrival has had on his department.\n“There might be days where those are the only calls that we run,” Nevin said. “But you know, four days after that, we dont go at all. So it evens out.”\nBut then he acknowledged the county is under a strain trying to respond to those additional calls without additional tax revenue.\n“Right now were still dealing with, you know, trying to work within the same confines that we had four or five years ago,” he said.\nAlthough the assessed value of property in his district has spiked 74% since Tesla’s arrival, the fire department’s property tax revenue has grown by only 7%.\n‘Tesla helped me figure myself out’\nTesla contends USA TODAY’s focus on safety issues is unfair. The company declined to make anyone available for an interview but said in a statement that “a few isolated incidents ... are not representative of our overall safety culture at Gigafactory 1.”\n“Tesla, our suppliers, and our contractors make up over 10,000 people on-site – the size of a small city,” the statement said. “To report that both personal and work-related medical emergencies over the course of four years make Tesla an outlier is unfair and misleading.”\nAlthough Tesla claimed to have a better injury rate than other factories, it declined to provide any data to support the claim. Because injury totals couldn’t be obtained through a public records request, it was impossible to verify it by comparing it to publicly available industry averages.\nSo far, Tesla has met all of the requirements set by lawmakers to be eligible for the tax credits. Most of the employees at the factory are Nevada residents and the company has made $4.9 billion in capital investments, all for its own factory – including the value of the land, the building and all of the equipment inside of it.\nIsabelle West was hired at Tesla thanks to a program at her high school but struggled to find housing in the area. Here she stands at her work station inside the Tesla Gigafactory. Provided by Mikolaj Walczuk, Tesla\nThe average wage of Tesla workers is $30 an hour, four times Nevada’s minimum wage. And many of the jobs there require a skilled workforce, something Tesla is helping cultivate in the state by funding science and engineering programs in local schools and paying for college training for some workers.\nFor some, the factory has offered a career path that didn’t exist before.\nIsabelle West, an engaging 19-year-old with pink hair, grew up in Las Vegas. She struggled through high school and couldn’t get into college. But through a program for at-risk students at her school, she got an interview with Tesla.\n“And it took two weeks, but when that phone call (came in), my mom was right there with me,” West said. “And I was like, ‘I got the job!’\"\nWest started as a production associate making $14.50 an hour and is in a training program at the local community college to become a technician. Her tuition is covered by Tesla. She hopes to become an engineer some day, something she said she never would have imagined before.\n“Tesla kind of helped me figure out myself,” she said.\nThe housing crunch\nWhen West arrived in Reno for the job, she hit a major snag: She couldn’t find housing.\n“My parents actually went and bought for my graduation gift a little RV trailer type thing that I could live in,” she said. “Theyre like, ‘Oh you can just go get an RV spot and stay there and itll be cheaper on you.’”\nBut she couldn’t find an open RV spot anywhere near the Gigafactory. Some Tesla workers are living out of RVs parked on city streets or in Walmart parking lots. Telltale black-and-white Tesla parking passes hang from their rearview mirrors.\nSo West and her parents took to Craigslist looking for a roommate or affordable apartment. Again, no luck.\nEventually, the program that helped West get the job at Tesla also found her housing. She and other workers in her program are living in student housing near the University of Nevada, Reno.\nNot everyone is so lucky.\nDonald Thomas, a 50-year-old electrician from Michigan, lives in a tent next to the train tracks near downtown Reno. He moved here to work at the Gigafactory. While he was on the job, he lived in a hotel room paid for by his employer.\n\"I always enjoy the work,” he said of his time as an electrician. “I like to see what it looks like and what it does after it’s all put together, after it works. I’m standing there saying, ‘Damn, I did that.’”\nBut after a dispute with his foreman, he said he lost the job and his housing. He stayed at the homeless shelter for a while, but he said his tools were stolen there. Without his tools, he couldn’t find work.\nA camp for homeless people is seen along the edge of the Truckee River in Reno on April 5, 2018. The arrival of the Tesla Gigafactory has exacerbated a housing shortage in the Reno area. Jason Bean, Reno Gazette Journal\nReno is in the midst of a critical housing shortage . The city’s only homeless shelter is chronically over capacity. The weekly motels relied on as housing of last resort by 4,000 people are being torn down. The waiting list for housing assistance is so long that new names are no longer being added.\nApartment vacancy rates are near zero. The median housing price has spiked to $400,000. And no-cause evictions are up 300% as landlords sell out to new landlords, who in turn raise the rent.\nEven Tesla’s Musk has lamented the lack of local housing, saying it’s the biggest constraint on growth at the Gigafactory.\n“Were looking at creating a sort of housing compound just on the site of the Gigafactory, using high quality kind of mobile homes, which I think would be great because then people could actually just walk here,” he said at a 2018 tech summit.\nSo far, that housing compound has not been built, leaving workers on the road commuting from outside the area.\nTraffic has increased exponentially on the highway running through the industrial park that’s home to the Gigafactory, jumping from 5,100 to 19,000 vehicles a day in three years. On the freeway between the park and Reno, traffic has increased 50% in the same time period.\nThe Reno City Council has been reacting to the housing shortfall by expanding the homeless shelter, creating dorm-style workforce housing and planning for a tiny-home village.\nBut very little, if any, of that work was done – or planned – before the region went after the Gigafactory project.\n“We could have done better ... when it comes to zoning and other things that would encourage more affordable housing, more infill, more multi-family,” said Mike Kazmierski, who heads the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada. “Its time to play catch up.”\nFil Corbitt and Emily Liu, producers with The City podcast, contributed additional reporting to this story.\nPublished\n11:28 am UTC Nov. 12, 2019\nUpdated\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-12'),

The Tesla Model 3 is already being deployed and now even the Model Y is under consideration at a police department in Pennsylvania.\nAll it takes is a test drive… and looking at the numbers.\nThe Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office announced that they test drove a Model 3 to see if they should add Tesla vehicles to their fleet.\nThey wrote on Facebook :\n“Today, the Sheriff’s Office is test driving a Model 3* in hopes that we can add Tesla’s to our fleet. We have always been conscious of the environment and realize the importance of reducing our carbon footprint, while still providing the best public service to the citizens of Allegheny County.”\nIt looks like it went well because they now say that if they crunch the numbers and find Tesla vehicles to be affordable and cost-effective (not sure what’s the difference), they will look to add them to their fleet:\n“If we can ensure that these vehicles are affordable and cost effective, the Sheriff’s Office will be taking a very serious look at putting energy efficient Model Y’s on the street.”\nThey even directly mentioned the yet-to-be-released Model Y, which is a bigger hatchback version of the Model 3.\nWhile it has yet to be proven for the Model Y, some police departments have already crunched the numbers for the Model 3 as a patrol vehicle.\nEarlier this year, the Bargersville, Indiana, Police Department started updating its fleet to Tesla Model 3 vehicles .\nWhen it comes to performance, it’s not going to be an issue compared to the Dodge Chargers they are replacing. They went with a Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which is speedy despite not being the highest performance version of the car, and with a range of 240 miles, it greatly exceeds the average daily mileage of a patrol car, which is between 80 miles and 120 miles per day.\nAs for cost, Model 3 is the clear winner. The Standard Range Plus version that they bought is a little more expensive than the Charger at ~$41,000, but they expect gas savings of about $6,000 per year, which means that the Model 3 will almost pay for itself over its lifetime (they expect six years as a police vehicle).\nThey also expect significant maintenance savings with the Model 3.\nElectrek’s Take\nEvery police department, and every fleet manager really, should probably start looking at electric vehicles to update their fleet.\nFor police, the Model 3 seems to be making the most sense right now based on performance and cost – though I can see why the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office is interested in the Model Y.\nIt offers a little more room and they need to retrofit these vehicles with a significant amount of equipment.\nTesla vehicles could also be particularly interesting for the Sentry Mode feature and the integrated Tesla dashcam.\nI am sure they have different standards for law enforcement-grade recording systems, but Tesla could maybe make a version of those features especially for law enforcement.\nWhat do you think?

But what’s been harder to come by is an account of the impact the factory has had on the town it was built for — until this week, that is. USA Today’s The City podcast spent an episode vividly retelling how Tesla’s first Gigafactory came to Reno with a deep dive into the way it’s changed the city.\nIt’s a timely piece of journalism. On the same day that the episode and its companion piece were published, Tesla announced that its fourth Gigafactory will be built outside of Berlin , Germany. Tesla is close to starting production at its third Gigafactory in China , outside Shanghai, after racing through construction there across 2019. And New York state just wrote down the value of the company’s second Gigafactory in Buffalo by more than $800 million .\nThe Gigafactory arrived during a major housing crunch and a raging fight over Reno’s soul\nIn the episode, Reno Gazette-Journal reporter Anjeanette Damon takes listeners back through the multistate competition for Tesla’s first Gigafactory and talks to people — like a local brothel owner — who ultimately helped the deal come to fruition. She also digs at the central tensions currently in play out there, including how Tesla’s hiring spree has impacted Reno’s housing crisis and how the company leans on public resources that — thanks to the sweetheart tax abatements it landed — it’s ostensibly not paying for.\nThe Gigafactory has been in the news plenty over the last few years, including for allegations from whistleblowers about potential drug trafficking , hacking, and spying . But Damon digs into the more human toll of life as a Gigafactory worker. She uncovered nearly 1,300 calls to 911 (a rate of more than one per day), a repeated number of visits from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and accounts of workplace injuries that seem to have gone unreported, all of which build on previous reporting about the conditions at Tesla’s factories.\n“In the five years that we’ve had to asses the effect [the Gigafactory has] had on the workforce, on the community, I think there have been these ramifications that we talk about in the episode that nobody was really prepared for,” Damon said in an interview with The Verge. “Like, we knew there was going to be an issue with housing, which other cities are experiencing, too. But that’s become super critical.”\nIn the episode, Damon describes all the different ways Tesla employees seem to make the 20-minute trek outside of Reno each day. Some drive, while others take shuttle buses from semipermanent stays at hotel casinos or even Walmart parking lots. It builds on the previous three episodes of The City’s second season, which is all about how Reno is changing (and why it’s being changed) from a small free-wheeling city to something bigger and more buttoned up.\n“they’ve become the symbol for all the growth here.”\nTesla is just one part of that change, and Damon was quick to point out that other big tech companies like Apple have set up shop outside of Reno, with each addition ramping up the pressure. But, she says, “they’ve become the symbol for all the growth here, and kind of the changes in the worsening stratification that’s happening among the haves and have nots in this community.”\nTesla is known for its cars, but the company’s massive factories are just as crucial to its future. As the company starts bringing them to other countries, it’s worth exploring the impact they have on the cities and people who wind up working there. When I visited the Reno Gigafactory for our feature on the place last year , I also came away asking: “ What kind of company towns does Tesla plan to build around its Gigafactories? ”\nThis newest episode of The City is the best answer yet .\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-13'),

It was on a public charger in the middle of the street. It was not the most obvious choice if you want to do it unnoticed. Maybe they did not like my Dutch license plate. But there were more foreign cars also from The Netherlands. 1+1=2.\nHe shared an image of his Model X after the incident:\nSomebody set our families Tesla Model X on fire during a business trip in Düsseldorf, Germany. It was charging overnight on a public charger a few hundred meters from the rented appartment. @bonnienorman @DMC_Ryan @elonmusk Tesla hatred is a real thing. pic.twitter.com/FD09VdkTKi\nVandals have targeted Tesla vehicles and Tesla facilities before, like Supercharger stations, but it is difficult to prove that it is the case here.\nMany of them are being caught these days thanks to Tesla’s Sentry Mode, which captures actions around Tesla vehicles on video.\nHowever, in this case, Den Dal says that while he activated Sentry Mode, he didn’t have a flash drive to record the incident.\nIn order for Sentry Mode to work on a Tesla, you need a few accessories. We recommend Jeda’s Model 3 USB hub to be able to still use the other plugs and hide your Sentry Mode drive. For the drive, you can use a flash drive, but for more capacity, we recommend a Samsung portable SSD , which you need to format, but it gives you a ton of capacity, and it can be easily hidden in the Jeda hub.\nHe also contacted the local police, and there were no CCTV cameras watching the charging station, either.\nThe damage was significant, but it was apparently still drivable.\nElectrek’s Take\nI know for a fact that some people hate Tesla and it’s not below them to vandalize cars, but it’s hard to prove that it was the case here.\nIt is strange that they went after the only Tesla vehicle around, but stranger things have happened before.\nThe moral of the story is to make sure your Sentry Mode is working. While the alarm will not always prevent the incident from happening in the first place, you at least have a shot at catching the vandals.\nHopefully, he has a smooth experience with his insurance.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\nWatch on\nIt didnt take long for Teslas Smart Summon feature -- the app-based piece of autonomous tech that allows owners who cannot be bothered to walk to their car have it automatically drive to them -- to create some unsafe situations in crowded parking lots. It seems one of the issues that the Smart Summon feature has, if this video from Richmond, British Columbia, is any indication, is that\nTesla models equipped with it cannot read road markings very well to determine which lane theyre driving in.\nOf course, this is not the manner in which Smart Summon is supposed to be used in the first place. For one thing, the owner needs to have the car in his or her line of sight. And its probably not a good idea to use it in parking lots where there are multiple turns that the car has to make, and multiple travel lanes marked by yellow lines.\nIf you watch the very first seconds of the video, it appears that the car is entering the parking lot from an actual road, which is another thing owners are not supposed to do with Smart Summon.\nOne problem that seems apparent here is that we cant tell where the owner is in relation to the car, and the owner is not apparent to the person filming it either. Another problem is that the Tesla also seems unsure of where the owner is as well, and it stops randomly in a busy parking lot before entering a parking structure.\nRelated Story\nOfficial 0-60 mph times confirm the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette is supercar-fast\nWe hope that the car and the owner were eventually reunited -- everyone loves a heartwarming story, especially right before the holidays -- but this seems like a good demonstration of an environment where owners should never use Smart Summon. To be fair (to the car), it never seemed to reach a speed high enough to cause much mayhem, and this seems more of an owner problem than an autonomous technology problem.\nBut would you take a chance using this technology, which was rolled out just a couple of months ago, to \"summon\" your car from somewhere deep in the parking lot to the front of the store? In other words, would you trust it to not hit other cars, cause a rear-end collision by braking randomly, stray into oncoming traffic or run somebody over?\nSome owners clearly place more trust in autonomous technology than we do because there are some potential liability issues that we see here.\nRelated Story\nJay Ramey\nJay Ramey grew up around very strange European cars, and instead of seeking out something reliable and comfortable for his own personal use he has been drawn to the more adventurous side of the dependability spectrum.

If you prepare right, you should have a great driving and ownership experience during the winter.\nHere are some tips and accessories that can help you prepare your Model 3 for the winter.\nTesla Model 3 Winter Tips and Accessories\nModel 3 Winter Tires\nLet’s start with the obvious: winter tires. If you live in a place where it regularly snows in the winter, it’s not only recommended to get winter tires but it is often the law.\nIn many places, you will get a ticket if you don’t have winter tires by mid-December, which means that November is about the time when you need to take this seriously.\nThanks to their extremely responsive electric motors, Tesla vehicles have great potential for winter driving performance, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t have good winter tires.\nThe goal is to find a great balance between grip and rolling resistance. There’s no avoiding it, you are getting to get a poorer efficiency in the winter.\nThat’s still true with a gasoline-powered car, but it can arguably be worse for EVs with a shorter range if you are already subject to range anxiety.\nThe most recommended one for EV owners is the Michelin X-Ice Xi3 Winter Radial Tire. You get low resistance while still offering enough grip to go through snow without losing control.\nThe Michelin X-Ice Xi3 Winter Radial Tire is also available for the 19″ wheels of the Tesla Model 3 .\nYou can also buy direct from Tesla with their own winter packages, but those are more expensive since they only come with their own wheelsets.\nThe automaker matches them with Pirelli Winter SottoZero, which you can buy without the wheels ( 18″ , 19″ , 20″ ).\nTesla can sometimes arrange for installing tires bought without their wheel packages, but I had a tough time trying to get them to do that.\nApparently, they are more pro-active when it comes to winter tires in markets like Norway, but in North America, you are often better off dealing with third parties in my experience.\nTesla Model 3 Floormats\nFloor mats are a must-have in most climates, but they are especially useful in the winter where there’s snow.\nFor my Model 3, I tested a few different ones, and I have stuck with the ToughPRO Tesla Model 3 Floor Mats Set ( $80 on Amazon ):\nIt’s a fraction of the price of Tesla’s own set, and it meshes a lot better with the interior.\nOf course, floor mats make it a lot easier to clean and they will also reduce floor wear, which is going to help your car retain its value.\nTough Pro also has another floor mat kit for Model 3 that also includes mats for the trunk, frunk, and the storage area ( $180 on Amazon ).\nIf you are looking for something a little more heavy-duty, several friends recommend the 3D MAXpider ($205 on Amazon) .\nModel 3 doors and windows care\nThe Model 3’s door windows are frameless and while it looks awesome, it’s a little weaker and can be a problem in freezing weather.\nThe windows need to go slightly down in order to open the door safely and I’ve experienced them getting stuck to the rubber seal.\nPre-conditioning the vehicle’s cabin temperature can help and we are going to get into that, but if you want to go an extra step, you can apply some rubber seal protectant ( Amazon US – Amazon Canada ).\nIt helps keep the seal supple in freezing temperature.\nI applied it to all the seals on my Model 3. You just need to clean the rubber first and then apply the liquid all over it (though I focused mainly on the parts that touch the windows):\nI haven’t had issues with opening my doors in cold weather since – though I also make extensive use of the pre-conditioning, which we are going to get into now.\nModel 3 Pre-Heating and Battery Pre-Conditioning\nThe Tesla mobile app is your friend during the winter. You can use the mobile app to preheat the cabin and defrost the windshield.\nOf course, it consumes energy and you need to take that into consideration, especially if you are not plugged in.\nDepending on the temperature, I am preheating for 5 to 15 mins, but if you are experiencing difficulties opening your doors, I’d recommend doing it for even longer.\nI’ve heard Tesla sometimes recommending 30 to 45 minutes of pre-heating the cabin.\nLast winter, Tesla also released a feature battery “pre-conditioning” to heat the battery pack when the car is plugged in.\nThe automaker describes the feature:\n“When temperatures are near freezing, preconditioning will also heat your battery for better driving and charging performance. We recommend you plug in to reduce range loss, and start pre-conditioning about an hour before you plan to leave since it can take some time to warm up the battery in colder weather. Note: Requires vehicle software version 2017.50 or above.”\nThe feature is only available when the temperature is well below freezing. It hasn’t been clear exactly, but you will see part of the battery capacity become blue in the app along with a snowflake icon:\nI have seen it show up in the Tesla mobile app for my Model S at about -15℃ and below.\nModel 3 Range in Cold Weather\nThis is not unique to Model 3 or Tesla vehicles. It’s normal for any electric vehicles or even vehicles in general.\nCabin heating will take some energy away from the powertrain, but the efficiency also goes down to the temperature and winter tires.\nDepending on the conditions, you should expect 20 to 40% reduction in range. If you are willing to reduce your average speed and reduce the cabin temperature, you should be able to limit the range loss.\nIf it’s really cold outside, like -15℃ and below, you also need to expect a lower charge rate at Supercharger stations since your battery pack needs to heat up before achieving its max charge rate.\nHowever, if you are using navigation, you should be able to mitigate that with Tesla’s new On-route Battery Warmup feature released earlier this year.\nIn my experience, it is still perfectly usable for road trips, but you need certainly need to change your expectations versus long-distance travel in a warmer climate.\nIf you have anything to add about preparing your Model 3 for the winter, let us know in the comment section below.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

To ensure the race was as competitive as possible, it was held over half a mile (804 meters) as opposed to a normal quarter-mile.\nadvertisement scroll to continue\nAlso Read: Driven – 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance Is Charged With Appeal\nUnsurprisingly, the Tesla Model 3 Performance powered off the line at frightening speed and easily out-sprinted its combustion-engined rivals to 100 mph (160 km/h). Slowly, though, the C 63 S, Giulia Quadrifoglio, and M3 started to close in on the Tesla as they passed 130 mph (209 km/h). The Mercedes managed to overtake the Model 3 just before the finish line, but the EV did beat out the Alfa Romeo and BMW.\nFor the second test, the Top Gear crew set up a tight and twisty handling circuit to see if the Tesla could beat the potent Alfa Romeo in the handling department. According to Harris, the Giulia is beautifully sharp and a joy to drive through the corners. By comparison, the Tesla rolls more through the corners, feels lazier, and isn’t as controlled as the Italian sedan. Nevertheless, it managed to beat the Alfa Romeo, primarily because of its ability to launch out of corners with so much speed.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-10');

Hordes of folks look forward to the first road tests, anxious to find out if the production Roadster can back up the claims made for it two years ago. For anyone who needs a refresher, the stats are: Three motors and \"7,376\" pound-feet of torque, 0-60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds, 0-100 mph in 4.2 seconds, the quarter-mile in 8.9 seconds, top speed beyond 250 mph. The icing and cherry are delivered by a 200-kWh battery pack and a 620-mile range. Heady stuff, and thats all before the SpaceX options package that could deliver higher performance. So until the real-deal Roadster 2.0 arrives, perhaps a scale model can ease the hunger. Tesla commissioned a 1:18-scale metal facsimile, and oversaw production that started with the same CAD production drawings used for the actual car.\nThe two-pound display piece is 9.9 inches long, 4.5 inches wide, and 2.8 inches high. It contains more than 180 metal and plastic parts, plus genuine carpet in the cabin and trunk. The tinted targa top can be removed and stored in the back, the doors and trunk open, the steering wheel turns a set of center-lock alloys wrapped in real rubber. And while Roadster 2.0 Founders Edition customers will have to come up with $250,000 to claim ownership of one of the first 1,000 cars, this die-cast model will only set you back $250, the same price as every other Tesla die-cast model. This is one of the few instances youll hear of the Tesla being a bargain, as the LiveCarModel site sells the same car, called the \"1/18 Official Dealer Edition Tesla Roadster (Red)\" for $347.95.\nIf you made room in your heart and trophy case for more Tesla you cant have yet, the automakers shop also offers the Semi . This ones in 1:24 scale, weighs 3.3 pounds and stands 6.7 inches high, also with opening doors, a finished interior, and turning wheels. With truck production slated for next year, this models also a bargain relative to the real thing, costing $250 against the Tesla Semis price of either $150,000 or $180,000.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-11'),

While Tesla’s Autopilot system is much like Apple’s iOS in the way that it is confined to the electric car maker’s parameters, openpilot allows owners to dig deeper into their vehicles, and this results in some cars, including a pre-Autopilot 2014 Tesla Model S, gaining capabilities that are nearly comparable to AP1 cars.\nA demonstration of the system in action was recently shared by Tesla owner-enthusiast Bjorn Nyland on his YouTube channel. In it, Daniel Billing, the 2014 Model S owner, showcased how the aftermarket driver-assist system allows his vehicle to gain Autopilot capabilities. After a brief introduction of the open-sourced driver-assist system’s hardware, Billing took his pre-AP Model S to the highway and showcased how his vehicle behaves when it’s operating on its own.\nRemarkably, the 2014 Model S was incredibly smooth as it steered itself and followed other vehicles on the road. The interface of openpilot is even fully integrated with the Tesla Model S’ infotainment system, thanks to root access to the all-electric sedan. With this setup in place, openpilot looks very much like the part it is intended to play — a more accessible, affordable alternative to the Apple of driver-assist systems, Tesla’s Autopilot.\nThe performance of the pre-AP Model S in Nyland’s video is quite admirable considering that the vehicle does not even have a radar installed. comma.ai does offer a radar for openpilot, but the Model S owner noted that he has not gotten around to having the additional hardware installed yet. Once a radar is installed on the vehicle, it would not be surprising if Billings’ pre-AP Model S ends up performing comparably with an AP1 Model S , at least on the freeway.\nThat being said, there are some drawbacks with such a system. For one, openpilot does not feature Tesla’s Autopilot “nags,” which means that drivers could keep their hands off the steering wheel for extended periods of time. It is evident in Nyland’s video that the Model S owner is very cautious with the system, but with no nags in place, openpilot may end up fostering careless behavior from inattentive drivers. The system also appears to operate outside Tesla’s Neural Network, which means that its improvements will likely not follow the pace of newer vehicles in the electric car maker’s fleet.\nBut for what it’s intended for, openpilot seems like a solid solution. The demonstration of the system’s capabilities in Nyland’s video may be brief, but it does show a pretty good idea of just how well the Android of driver-assist systems works in the real world.\nWatch a Pre-AP Tesla Model S use Autopilot features in the video below.\nEarly Tesla Model S gets ‘Autopilot’ retrofit and it works surprisingly well\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-08'),

It would be nice if someone pulled your car up for you. Now, Tesla has released technology that allows the car to drive itself – a personal valet of sorts.\n“I think anyone that drives one for a day, they would have trouble going back, said Bill Painter who has been a Tesla owner for almost a year. He’ll be the first to tell you he’s obsessed with his ride.\n“It’s better than any other car out there. And it’s good for the environment.”\nThe all-electric Tesla brand is known for its autopilot feature that allows you to sit back while the car drives itself down the road – keeping with the flow of traffic and changing lanes too. But they recently added a new feature called Smart Summon -- taking things to another level.\n“Say you don’t want to walk all the way to your car, it’ll come to you,” said Painter with excitement.\nAll you do is open the Tesla app, choose ‘summon’, and the car can plot a path toward you -- making corrections for people and traffic along the way. It only moves when your finger is on the screen of your smartphone. When you let go, it stops.\nFor safety purposes, the feature will only work from 200 feet away and the operator should have eyes on the vehicle at all times. By law, the feature only works on private property, like parking lots. Cars on Ohio roads are required to have a driver behind the wheel.\nA car moving without a driver was enough to turn heads in the parking lot. Onlookers stopped to watch what was happening, admiring the car’s ability.\n“That is awesome,” said one man\n“It freaked me out when I parked the car,” said Nany Brewster who walked by the car as it was parking near hers. “I mean there’s nobody behind the wheel. That thing’s awesome.”\nThe car uses a number of cameras and sensors around the car to navigate the lot and adjust when obstacles or cars are around. There have been some mishaps with the new tech – operators not paying attention to where the car is going leading to minor fender benders. But the car travels no faster than 5 miles per hour in Smart Summon mode, and damage is typically minimal.\nDrivers using technology have caused thousands of accidents over the years. This time around, technology is working in our favor and will likely get even better with time. Tesla says their autonomous driving features are safer than humans behind the wheel.\n“The truth is distracted driving is on the rise and it’s making streets more dangerous,” said Painter. “To have technology on your side assisting and helping, and letting you take [on] the bigger processes, it’s definitely a safer option.”\nTesla models are becoming more affordable in price with even more savings since there’s no gas or oil changes. And if you’re worried about finding a charging station, the car always knows where the nearest one is. Painter says finding juice has never been a concern. He charges his Model 3 every night like a cell phone.\n“I can’t imagine going to a gas station and filling up anymore. You wake up every morning with a full tank,” he said happily.\nThe features Tesla is implementing appear to be the way of the future. So, don’t be surprised when you see drivers not holding the wheel – or missing from the driver’s seat altogether.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-08'),

IHS reports EV sales were only 1.2%, or about 207,600, of the 17.3 million vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2018. Nearly 80% of new EVs registered in the U.S. last year were Tesla vehicles, according IHS.\nFor the first nine months of this year, EV sales inched up to account for 1.4% of the U.S. market, according to IHS.\n\"We explored the green efficiency niche and now you want to get more people involved, were looking at a performance niche,\" Brinley said. \"Ultimately, it has to be even more than that to get to a mainstream buyer. Were not quite there yet.\"\nIHS Markit forecasts EVs will account for 9% of U.S. sales by 2026, despite the number of EV models on the market increasing from nearly 20 to more than 120 during that time frame.\nTesla-effect\nMany credit Tesla for the change in conversation around EVs as performance vehicles. While \"traditional\" automakers have focused on building EVs to meet stricter government fuel economy regulations over the last decade, the Silicon Valley car manufacturer created a culture of technology and performance around the relatively young technology.\nWhen General Motors\nreleased the Chevrolet Bolt, its subcompact hatchback EV for the masses in 2016, Tesla introduced the Model S P100D with \"Ludicrous Mode.\" The new Tesla model, depending on testing, competes or beats acceleration and 0-60 times of some of the most expensive supercars in the world.\nVisitors look at a Tesla Model 3 during a press preview of the Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, northwest of Seoul, on March 28, 2019.\nJung Yeon-Je | AFP | Getty Images\n\"Theyre seeing the success Tesla has had with well-styled, performance EVs versus kind of purely functional and Earth-friendly EVs like the [Nissan] Leaf and Bolt,\" Brauer said. \"Theyre all going to try and expand the dimensions of appeal that an EV offers.\"\nEven Teslas mass-market Model 3, depending on the model, can achieve 0-60 mph of between 3.2 seconds and 5.6 seconds. That compares the Chevrolet Bolt at 6.5 seconds or BMW i3 at just under 7 seconds.\nCompelling EVs\nOne of the most highly-anticipated debuts of the LA Auto Show is the global unveiling of Ford Motors \"Mustang-inspired\" SUV , which is expected to be called the \"Mach-E.\"\nThe name as well as the affiliation to Fords iconic Mustang pony car is setting the bar high for the automakers second-attempt at an EV in the past decade. The first was a version of its Focus compact sedan, which debuted in 2011 to meet government mandates. Ford sold less than 10,000 units in seven years.\nThe expected Mach E name is a play on the Mustang Mach 1, a renowned performance model of the iconic pony car.\n\"It plays right into the history of Teslas kind of success. Not just to make an EV but to make a compelling, engaging SUV that makes you want to drive it not just to save the planet but because its fun to drive and it looks good,\" Brauer said.\nVolkswagens ID. Space Vizzion concept is a preview of a production vehicle that the automaker plans to release in late 2021.\nVW\nAnother global debut at the show is Volkswagens ID. Space Vizzion, an EV concept that its calling the \"crossover of tomorrow.\" Based on a teaser image, the vehicle will be a sporty crossover/wagon, which VW says will preview a new production model in late-2021.\n\"So far, with our ID. family, we have shown what is possible with electric vehicles in each known car category,\" Klaus Bischoff, head of Volkswagen design, said in a release. \"With the ID. SPACE VIZZION we create a new, fully electric segment.\"\nOther expected additions to the EV performance segment at the show include the Audi e-tron Sportback and a base model of the well-received Porsche Taycan, which can achieve 0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds.

Then proceeds to try to run us off the road.”\nDo managed to avoid a crash and stopped at the next intersection.\nThe man in the minivan stopped next to them, still in shock, Do’s wife asked the man “why are you putting our lives in danger?”\nBased on his response, the man appeared to had an issue with the fact that they were driving a Tesla (warning: bad language):\nWhen asked why he did it, you can hear the driver says that they are driving “a piece of s**t.”\nThis footage is from Do’s Blackvue dashcam , which can record sounds, but the dangerous driving behavior was also recorded by Tesla’s integrated dashcam feature, which records all around the vehicle:\nDo told Electrek that he submitted the video to the local police department in Avon, Ohio who should have no problem identifying the suspect with both videos and a clear look at the plates.\nIn some jurisdictions, including in Ohio, road rage incidents that put people in danger can lead to criminal charges.\nElectrek’s Take\nWe have seen some Tesla haters doing some bad things before like vandalizing cars, blocking charging stations or even coal-rolling , but this is a whole new level to me.\nThat guy was literally putting people in danger and why? Because he didn’t like the car they were driving?\nIt blows my mind that there are people like that in the world.

According to recent reports, for example, Autopilot appears to have gained the capability to recognize animals such as dogs.\nThe recent observations were shared by Tesla owner-enthusiast @greentheonly , who has been studying the inner workings of the electric car maker’s driver-assist system for years. In a recent post on Twitter, the Tesla owner noted that his vehicle, which was running 19.36.2.1, was recognizing dogs as pedestrian objects.\nLooks pretty elaborate and not a single frame fluke? Or am I imagining things?\nSomebody, walk your dog in front of your car and see if it shows up on IC to test (put car in D)?\nAll cams but pillars it seems. pic.twitter.com/8u846Vsq1A\n— green (@greentheonly) November 11, 2019\nTesla has not mentioned any improvements in its vehicles’ capability to detect and respond to animals on the road yet, though Mark Schey , a Model 3 owner, opted to conduct a brief test by having a dog sit in front of his all-electric sedan. Sure enough, the vehicle did detect the animal, recognizing it as a human in the Model 3’s center display. With this in mind, it does appear that Tesla’s vehicles are improving in terms of their capability to detect animals, or at least dogs, while they are operating.\nnice!\n— green (@greentheonly) November 11, 2019\nThese recent observations follow reports from Tesla owners about Autopilot responding safely to animals. Just recently, a video went viral among the EV community depicting Autopilot seemingly detecting and safely avoiding a family of ducks that are crossing the road. The incident remains unconfirmed considering that no telemetry data has been provided, but it does bode well for Tesla and Autopilot’s eventual capability to react to unexpected obstacles on the road.\nIn this video, Tesla Model 3 #Autopilot detects a group of ducks crossing the highway and avoids them. The ducks survive !🦆🦆🦆 @elonmusk 🦆🦆🦆 pic.twitter.com/GC2ChTCofS\n— Tesla_saves_lives (@SavedTesla) November 11, 2019\nThe capability to detect and safely respond to animals is an important aspect of inner-city driving that Tesla must master before it could successfully fully roll out its Full Self-Driving suite to the fleet. Inner-city driving is far more unpredictable than highway driving, after all, with vehicles constantly having to deal with people, animals, and objects at any given time. If @greentheonly’s observations are accurate and Tesla is indeed working on animal detection, it would be yet another step forward for Elon Musk’s goal of deploying a fleet of vehicles that are fully autonomous.\nThe proficiency of Tesla’s fleet in recognizing and reacting to objects on the road depends in no small part to the growth of the company’s Neural Network , which gets fed with real-world driving data by the electric car maker’s vehicles. As more cars provide Tesla with valuable real-world driving data with and without Autopilot, the company’s Neural Net continues to improve. Indications that Teslas can now recognize animals on the road as pedestrian obstacles are an encouraging sign that the company’s vehicles are learning, and they are becoming more proficient with every update.\nTesla Autopilot video suggests that dogs are now recognized as pedestrian objects\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-13'),

The latest order bodes well for the parts manufacturer, as it proves that its components remain viable and competitive even as the auto industry transitions to electric.\nThe electric car parts order was shared by German motoring publication Automobilwoche , which observed that despite ElringKlinger not mentioning the Tesla Model Y, the company did note that the parts will be for a “leading American electric vehicle manufacturer.” Tesla is pretty much the only company that fits that bill in the United States today.\nDetails for the parts order are relatively few, though ElringKlinger has stated that the volume is in the “mid-to-high double-digit millions.” In a statement to the publication, CEO Stefan Wolf stated that the order represents a step forward in ElringKlinger’s efforts at remaining a formidable parts supplier in the age of electromobility.\n“This follow-up order underlines just how advantageous our lightweight components are for electric vehicles. It represents a further step in the successful implementation of our strategy of achieving more than a quarter of our revenue in the next decade with the future fields of structural lightweight construction and electromobility,” the CEO said.\nThe mass production of the electric vehicle parts, described by Automobilwoche as a “cockpit crossbeam,” is expected to begin at the German supplier’s Fremont, CA factory next year. Considering that ElringKlinger is already producing the part for the Tesla Model 3, the new order seems to suggest that the components are intended to be used in the Tesla Model Y crossover.\nThe recent reports from ElringKlinger bode well for Tesla’s upcoming Model Y ramp . If Tesla is indeed placing massive orders for the upcoming vehicle’s parts, it would suggest that the company is looking to start its Model Y ramp at levels that far exceed that of the Model 3. This would be a pretty big bet for Tesla, though it is one that CEO Elon Musk appears to be willing to take. Musk, after all, has high expectations for the Model Y, stating during the Q3 2019 earnings call that the vehicle will likely outsell the Model 3, Model S, and Model X combined.\nThe Tesla Model Y was initially announced with a Fall 2020 delivery date, which was notably more tempered and conservative than the company or CEO Elon Musk’s usual aggressive timetables. This date has since been adjusted, with the company stating that Model Y may be launched as early as Summer 2020 .\nTesla Model 3 supplier receives massive order for Model Y parts: report\n', 'TSLA', '2019-11-12'),

That system is designed to automatically change lanes and keep a safe distance from other vehicles.\nThe black Tesla had left a freeway and was moving at a high rate of speed when it ran a red light and slammed into a Honda Civic at an intersection, police said. A man and woman in the Civic died at the scene. A man and woman in the Tesla were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. No arrests were immediately made.\nAn NHTSA statement said the agency has assigned its special crash investigation team to inspect the car and the crash scene. That team has inspected 13 crashes involving Tesla vehicles the agency believed were operating on the Autopilot system.\nResults were published in two of those cases, one of which involved Autopilot. Results are pending in the other 10 cases, the agency said in a statement.\nMessages were left seeking comment from Tesla.\nAnother Tesla crash killed a woman Sunday in Indiana. State police said the driver, Derrick Monet, 25, of Prescott Valley, Arizona, was seriously injured after he rear-ended a fire truck parked along Interstate 70 in Putnam county. His wife, Jenna Monet, 23, was pronounced dead at a hospital.\nDerrick Monet told investigators he regularly used his Tesla’s Autopilot mode, but didn’t recall whether he had it activated at the time of the accident, state police Sgt Matt Ames said.\nEarlier this month, a Tesla struck a police cruiser and a disabled vehicle in Connecticut. Nobody was seriously hurt. The driver told state police he was using the Autopilot system and had looked around to check on his dog in the back seat.\nBoth Tesla and the NHTSA have advised that advanced driver assist systems such as Autopilot are not entirely autonomous but require human drivers to pay attention at all times. But several crashes – some fatal – have been blamed on driver inattention linked to overconfidence in such systems.\nIn one crash report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) referred to it as “automation complacency”.\nThe NTSB has criticized Tesla’s Autopilot. In September, the agency said that in a 2018 crash in Culver City where a Tesla hit a fire truck, the design of the Autopilot system “permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task”. Nobody was hurt in that accident.\nThe NTSB determined in September 2017 that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver’s over reliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car.\nThe headline on this article was amended on 1 January 2020 to clarify that authorities have not yet said whether Autopilot was involved in the California crash.\nTopics\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-01'),

Deliveries to customers will occur at the Shanghai factory. Earlier this week, more than a dozen Tesla employees took delivery of the Model 3.\n“We believe China could become the biggest market for Model 3,” the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.\nProducing vehicles in China for Chinese customers allows Tesla to bypass tariffs, but it’s no guarantee that this will be the revenue-generating boon the company needs to push itself into sustained profitability. EV sales have been sluggish for other automakers in China over the past several quarters as the government has rolled back subsidies on new-energy vehicles.\nThe company and its CEO Elon Musk are jumping into the market with gusto, despite gloomy EV sales. Tesla has said the production line at the factory in China will have a capacity of 150,000 units annually and will be a simplified, more cost-effective version of the Model 3 line at its Fremont, Calif. factory.\nAerial photo of Tesla factory in New Lingang District, Shanghai. The number of Model 3 cars in the parking lot is about 500.\nTesla also said this second-generation Model 3 line will be at least 50% cheaper per unit of capacity than its Model 3-related lines in Fremont and at its Gigafactory in Sparks, Nev.\nTesla struck a deal with the Chinese government in July 2018 to build a factory in Shanghai. It was a milestone for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who has long viewed China as a crucial market. And it was particularly notable because China agreed for this to be a wholly owned Tesla factory, not a traditional joint venture with the government. Foreign companies have historically had to form a 50-50 joint venture with a local partner to build a factory in China.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has pushed forward plans to phase out joint-venture rules for foreign automakers by 2022. Tesla was one of the first beneficiaries of this rule change.\nThe opening of the China factory comes at a time of rising trade tensions between China and the United States. Tesla has been particularly exposed to relations between China and the U.S., and the resulting rising tariffs. Tesla builds its electric sedans and SUVs at its factory in Fremont, Calif. and ships them to China, which subjects the vehicles to an import tariff.\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-02'),

It picked a rough time to start.\nThe country’s car industry is in a major slump , with momentum expected to slow further as a broad economic slowdown becomes more pronounced. Tesla also faces stiff competition from local carmakers and foreign rivals with more manufacturing experience in China.\nBut analysts say that if Tesla CEO Elon Musk pulls off his risky strategy — it built its big, new Shanghai factory to grow its business, pump out more cars and better target Chinese customers — the company could give China’s car market a much-needed jolt of energy. Local, troubled brands would need to up their game or die out.\nTesla could make out well, too. It has started electric vehicle production in China ahead of some foreign rivals, and its Shanghai factory could push its production costs lower. Success means grabbing a bigger slice of the world’s largest car market .\nInvestors, at least, are optimistic about the company’s plans: After falling as much as 46% earlier this year, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock hit an all-time high this week.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the unveiling of the new Tesla Model Y in Hawthorne, California on March 14, 2019.\nFrederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\nA ‘turning point’ for the car industry\nAfter years of growth, car sales in China have now dropped for 17 consecutive months.\nSales are expected to drop 8% for all of 2019, according to a forecast published by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That’s worse than last year’s 3% slide, the first annual decline since 1990.\nNext year looks a little bit better, but sales are still expected to decline 2%.\n“The car market has reached a turning point,” said Wang Hexu, a car industry analyst for Shanghai-based Hwabao Securities. He said that while the “high growth period” is over, sales will pick up again after 2020.\nThe slowing sales stem from China’s broader economic problems, which have been compounded by rising debt , the US-China trade war and a severe shortage of pork , the country’s staple meat. The buying power of Chinese consumers has also taken a hit, and big ticket items like cars are among the first things people avoid when budgets are tight.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

It has taken less than a year from the start of construction of the $5bn (£3.8bn) Shanghai factory in January to the delivery of the first vehicles.\nThe factory, announced in July 2018 , is Tesla’s first facility outside the US and will have an annual capacity of 150,000 Model 3 cars per year, compared with 350,000 in its main factory in Fremont, California.\nA Tesla employee proposes to his girlfriend with a China-made Tesla Model 3 vehicle filled with flowers at the delivery ceremony at the Shanghai factory. Photograph: Sun Yilei/Reuters\nTesla is aiming for China to become the largest market for its Model 3, outstripping the US. China is already the largest market for mid-sized premium sedans that rival the Model 3, according to IHS Markit data cited by the carmaker.\n“From now onwards, China-made Model 3 vehicles will start running on China’s large streets and small lanes,” Tesla’s vice-president, Tao Lin, said.\nThe carmaker will enter a crowded field, with some reports suggesting there are hundreds of companies aiming to mass-produce electric cars. However, industry insiders expect many of these to fail and a recent slump in Chinese car sales has caused severe difficulties for some of the more established names. For electric carmakers the general slump has been exacerbated by cuts to government subsidies.\nThe subsidy cuts prompted the Warren Buffett-backed electric carmaker BYD to slash its profit forecasts in October. Nio, a premium carmaker pitched as a direct rival to Tesla, was forced to raise $200m in September from its chief executive and major shareholder, Tencent, in response to deepening losses.\nNio on Monday announced revenues rose by 22% to 1.7bn yuan (£190m) in the third quarter of 2019. That was higher than expected by analysts, but Nio said that its continued operation over the next year still depended on raising new finance.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nTesla has bet billions of dollars on China, with its Shanghai factory opening well ahead of another planned “gigafactory” in Berlin , its first in Europe.\nTesla claims its Model 3 pricing will put it on a similar level to fossil fuel-powered mid-sized sedans, even before gas savings and other benefits.\nShanghai will also produce Tesla’s Model Y crossover SUV , which is built using the same platform as the Model 3. Model Y deliveries are scheduled for the summer of 2020.\nTopics\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-30'),

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the crash of a speeding Tesla that killed two people in Gardena, the agency announced Tuesday.\nAgency spokesman Sean Rushton wouldn’t say whether the Tesla Model S was on Autopilot when it crashed on Dec. 29 in Gardena. That system is designed to automatically change lanes and keep a safe distance from other vehicles.\nThe black Tesla had left the 91 Freeway and was moving at a high rate of speed when it ran a red light and slammed into a Honda Civic at an intersection, police said.\nA man and woman in the Civic died at the scene.\nA man and woman in the Tesla were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. No arrests were immediately made.\nThe crash is also being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department.\nAn NHTSA statement said the agency has assigned its special crash investigation team to inspect the car and the crash scene. That team has inspected a total of 13 crashes involving Tesla vehicles that the agency believed were operating on the Autopilot system. Results were published in two of those cases, one of which involved Autopilot. Results are pending in the other 10 cases, the agency said in a statement.\nMessages were left Tuesday night seeking comment from Tesla.\nAnother Tesla crash killed a woman Sunday in Indiana. State police said the driver, Derrick N. Monet, 25, of Prescott Valley, Arizona, was seriously injured after he rear-ended a fire truck parked along Interstate 70 in Putnam County. His wife, Jenna N. Monet, 23, was pronounced dead at a hospital.\nDerrick Monet told investigators he regularly uses his Tesla’s Autopilot mode, but didn’t recall whether he had it activated at the time of the accident, state police Sgt. Matt Ames said.\nEarlier this month, a Tesla struck a police cruiser and a disabled vehicle in Connecticut but nobody was seriously hurt. The driver told state police that he was using the Autopilot system and had looked around to check on his dog in the back seat.\nBoth Tesla and the NHTSA have advised that advanced driver assist systems such as Autopilot aren’t entirely autonomous but require human drivers to pay attention at all times. But several crashes — some fatal — have been blamed on driver inattention linked to overconfidence in such systems. In one crash report, the National Transportation Safety Board referred to it as “automation complacency.”\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Tesla’s Autopilot. In September, that agency said that in a 2018 crash in Culver City where a Tesla hit a fire truck, the design of the Autopilot system “permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.” Nobody was hurt in that accident.\nThe NTSB determined in September 2017 that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver’s over reliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car.\n33.888349-118.308962\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-31'),

(Credit: Tesla)\nPosted on\nDecember 27, 2019\nTesla owners may soon enjoy a feature called “Nap Mode” that will allow them to sleep in the car while the climate control is on and wake up to an alarm clock. Elon Musk confirmed that this feature can be added when Twitter user @GutGutM3 asked via Twitter and the Tesla CEO promptly replied with a brief, “Ok.”\n“Nap Mode” will come handy for passengers who want a snooze in the middle of a long drive, or perhaps those who just want a bit of shut-eye for some energy boost in the middle of the day. With climate control set to optimal cabin temperature, passengers are guaranteed to have the most comfortable conditions for their naps as possible. The feature’s integrated alarm clock will likely be incredibly useful as well, preventing passengers from oversleeping.\nOk\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2019\nNap Mode can be considered a cousin of the recently rolled out Camp Mode that came with the 2019.40.50 software update. With Camp Mode, a Tesla owner can save some money while on the road and stay in their vehicles instead of renting motel or hotel rooms. The big batteries of the vehicle can support airflow, temperature, interior lighting, or even power devices with no problem. What’s even better is that the use of Camp Mode will probably not drain a Tesla’s batteries much at all, considering their size.\nApart from Nap Mode, Musk also confirmed that Tesla owners may soon have access to the extremely popular streaming service Disney+ . This opens a treasure trove of Disney films, Pixar movies, and binge-worthy shows such as The Mandalorian. This is in addition to the recently discovered possibility of having HBOGo, HBO Now, Crunchyroll and other streaming apps being added to Tesla’s in-car entertainment system .\nLikewise, there were other cool features requested by users that seemingly got the nod of the Tesla chief. Musk, for one, confirmed that it’s possible to make the most of the vehicle’s cameras to make it easier to handle negotiating tight spaces. The CEO also wrote about a future feature that will adjust the vehicle’s traffic-based navigation system automatically when one switches to another user profile.\nElon Musk has previously stated that he wants Tesla’s electric cars to be among the most fun things that people can buy. With their ever-growing suite of features, Tesla’s vehicles appear to be well on their way to becoming exactly what Musk wants them to be. What’s particularly great about them lies in the fact that these convenience features go well together, such as Camp Mode and Tesla Theater. Used together, these two features are bound to give passengers an in-car experience unlike any other.\nDuring the long chat over Twitter, Musk did not forget to mention how he appreciates the work of his team and how Tesla is not forgetting its mission:\nIt is an honor & a privilege to work with so many great engineers\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2019\nThe overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2019\nTesla ‘Nap Mode’ will let owners sleep but wake to an alarm clock\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

A company team already operating locally has decided to flout convention and set up a pop-up shop in Tel Aviv’s Ramat Aviv Mall instead of waiting for an official company showroom, the people said.\nThe pop-up shop will enable potential customers to examine some of Tesla’s cars, especially its popular Model 3, and place advance orders for cars for a fee. When Tesla launched its Model 3 in the U.S. in 2016, it charged interested parties $1,000 for the option of being some of the first customers to receive it, and collected 253,000 orders within 36 hours. When it launched its first pickup truck, the Cybertruck, in November, the company only charged $100, receiving 146,000 orders within three days.\nA Model 3 Tesla. Photo: Shutterstock\nRamat Aviv Mall caters to the upper socioeconomic class of north Tel Aviv and neighboring towns, making it especially suited for the launch of a new car brand that will be classified in Israel as a luxury car due to its starting price of NIS 250,000 (approximately $72,300). Israel’s decision to cut tax benefits for electric cars as of January 1, 2020 means that Tesla models are expected to be relatively expensive in the country. Luxury brands like BMW’s Mini and DS Automobiles held similar events in the mall at the past, as did brands like Mazda Motor Corporation and Peugeot.\nSeveral Tesla cars have already arrived in Israel for tests, but have yet to receive permission from the Israeli Ministry of Transport. While the Cybertruck will only proceed to production at the end of 2020, the company already manufactures four electric car models. Tesla will be the first car manufacturer to sell its vehicles in Israel itself instead of via an importer, but it has contacted several local operators to test the possibility of collaborations in fields such as trade in, the people familiar with the matter said.\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-30'),

A tiny camera located above the rearview mirror will begin to record video and sound of unauthorized intruders when triggered.\nThe idea of using the cabin-facing camera was brought up during the latest Tesla Owners Online podcast by Model 3 owner and YouTuber, Tesla Raj . In a very traditional Musk fashion, which has given rise to countless features after Twitter suggestions, the Tesla CEO greenlit the idea with a simple “Ok” reply.\nThis idea for activating the interior-facing camera was first confirmed by Musk in early 2019 when keen-eyed new Model 3 owners took notice of the never-before-seen hardware. According to the Tesla chief at that time, “It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.”\nOk\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 5, 2020\nLooking back at Tesla’s revised master plan , the company aims to have a fleet of self-driving robotaxis in the future that will become the backbone for Tesla’s ridesharing network. Additionally, Tesla owners can enroll their vehicles in the network and earn extra money by chaperoning passengers. This model will further help owners reduce their cost of ownership over time. The internal camera was always designed with security in mind by keeping an eye on passengers. For Tesla owners worried about privacy, Musk noted that an option to disable the camera will be made available.\nTesla is taking steps to make the dream of having robotaxis on the road come true by taking the necessary steps to achieve Full Self-Driving. The company has registered over 2 billion miles worth of driving in Autopilot , a treasure trove of data that can help the company perfect the technology to please even the tightest regulatory bodies in the world.\nTurning on the cabin-facing camera when Sentry Mode is activated can be seen as the first proof of concept for the previously unused hardware. Additionally, the ability to record both video and sound of intruders will only further the narrative that vandalizing Tesla vehicles will only lead to criminal arrests .\nSentry Mode has caught some of the most senseless attacks on Tesla vehicles from taking video footage of keying incidents , hit-and-runs, and other forms of vandalism.\nIt’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 5, 2019\nTesla will activate in-cabin camera for Sentry Mode to record video of intruder break-ins, confirms Musk\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-05'),

Customers rushed to purchase their zippy electric rides before a federal tax credit expired, and the numbers were pretty great. The company hit all-time records in production and delivery, grinding out 105,000 vehicles (86,958 of them Model 3’s) and moving 112,000 to customers’ garages and home-adjacent sidewalks around the world. In all, Tesla delivered 367,500 cars last year, a 50 percent jump from 2018, and the company’s stock climbed by more than 3 percent on Friday on the news. Oh, and it reached the auspicious milestone of $420 a share at the end of the year, which Elon Musk obviously had to note in a tweet . What’s next for the company?

Brown | AFP | Getty Images\nElon Musk is best known as the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — but way before his success in Silicon Valley, he worked odd jobs to get by.\nAt 17, Musk left his home in South Africa and headed to Canada, where he became a citizen (his mother, Maye , was born there) and stayed with his cousin, according to the book \" Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future \" by Ashlee Vance.\nAt first, Musk worked at his cousins farm in Waldeck, Saskatchewan (a village that as of 2016 had a population of fewer than 300 people ), tending to vegetables and shoveling grain bins, according to the book \"Elon Musk.\"\nElon Musk tweet here: picture of him at 17-years-old on his cousins farm.\nThen Musk learned to cut logs with a chainsaw in Vancouver, British Columbia, according to the book.\nHowever, after asking at the unemployment office what jobs paid the best, Musk took on his hardest gig yet: cleaning out the boiler room of a lumber mill.\nFor $18 an hour, Musk said in the biography that he had to \"put on this hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in. Then, you have to shovel, and you take the sand and goop and other residue, which is still steaming hot, and you have to shovel it through the same hole you came in through.\"\n\"There is no escape,\" Musk said. \"Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you stay in there for more than 30 minutes, you get too hot and die.\"\nThirty people started out at the beginning of the week with Musk, according to the book. By the third day, five people were left. By the end of the week, Musk was left with only two other people to do the work.\nMusk eventually gave up manual labor and pursued tech. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May of 1997, and then debated attending Stanford University in California for its Material Science Engineering graduate program. Though Musk never enrolled in classes at Stanford (although he was admitted), he did venture to Silicon Valley, and applied for a job at Netscape. He was interested in the then-nascent internet, he told entrepreneur and investor Kevin Rose in 2012 .\nMusk didnt get the job at Netscape. He had a guess for why he didnt land it: He had a degree from Wharton and was accepted to do graduate-school work in physical and materials science, but he didnt have a computer science degree, nor several years under his belt working at a software company.\n\"I actually tried hanging out in the [Netscape] lobby, but I was too shy to talk to anyone. So Im just like standing in the lobby,\" he said. \"It was pretty embarrassing.\"\nDespite Musks inauspicious start in the professional world, in 1999 he sold his first company , Zip2, to Compaq for roughly $300 million . He started Zip2 after his experience applying to Netscape, deciding that instead of pursing a PhD at Stanford, he would first try to start a company. Musk said he figured he could always return to education if starting a business did not work out.\nHe used the money from the Zip2 sale to found X.com, an online financial services platform that merged with Confinity in 2000, and later became PayPal. In 2002, eBay purchased PayPal for $1.5 billion.\nMusk went on to start SpaceX in 2002, followed by Tesla in 2003. In 2016, he founded Neuralink, and a year later, he created The Boring Company.\nToday, Elon Musk is worth $27.5 billion, according to Forbes .\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-03'),

The automaker is poised to deliver between 95,000 and 101,000 vehicles for its fourth quarter, Cowen said in a note to clients Monday. This would put deliveries for the year at roughly 356,000, below the 360,000 to 400,000 range the company has given as a guidance. The new analyst projection comes as the first Tesla Model 3s built in Shanghai are being delivered. China is seen as a large growth opportunity for Tesla, and the U.S.-based electric car company is delivering vehicles from the new factory less than a year after breaking ground to build it. Cowen, which has an underperform rating on the stock, raised its price target to $210 per share from $190 per share, citing growing demand in China and the Netherlands. Even with that increase, the price target still represents a 51% drop from where the stock closed Friday. Excluding those two countries, however, demand will be 7% lower for this quarter than the same one last year, according to Cowen. The decline \"highlights the demand saturation we are seeing across most mature markets as we shift from pent-up demand to steady flow demand,\" the note said. Teslas profit margins could also take a hit if the company is not able to lower the production costs for its cheaper Model 3 as the car takes up a bigger share of its sales, the note said.

The improvements from the update were quite incredible, at one point enabling the mid-tier Model 3 to hit 60 mph in just 3.48 seconds.\nYouTuber and Tesla enthusiast Quantrillous Montgomery purchased the $2,000 Acceleration Boost package for his Model 3 last week. According to Tesla, the paid boost allowed the Model 3 Dual Motor AWD to reduce its 0-60 mph time from 4.4 seconds to 3.9 seconds. If the Tesla owner’s recent tests are any indication, it appears that the Acceleration Boost may have made the Model 3 Dual Motor AWD even faster than expected.\nQuantrillous used a Dragy device to measure the stats of his upgraded Model 3. In his first run, the Draggy recorded a 0-60 MPH time of 3.72 seconds, much faster than the anticipated 3.9 seconds Tesla claimed the boost would provide. The quarter-mile time was recorded at 11.82 seconds. Following runs were equally impressive, particularly a sprint where the vehicle hit the 60 mph mark in 3.48 seconds (with a 1-foot rollout). That’s a bit faster than the Model 3 Performance’s initial 0-60 mph time.\nEvidently, the Performance Boost has given owners of the Model 3 Dual Motor AWD a noticeable improvement in speed and acceleration. This is quite impressive considering that the update seemed to have been significant enough that some vehicles are actually performing better than Tesla’s estimates. A half-second improvement in 0-60 mph times is no joke, after all, and to have a boost just offered as a paid OTA update is very disruptive.\nHalf-second 0-60 mph improvements that are downloaded over-the-air are pretty much unheard of in the automotive industry. Traditional vehicles need engine tuning , transmission modifications, aftermarket exhausts, or some other form of physical upgrade that will end up costing thousands of dollars in parts to achieve the same improvements. Not to mention, it also takes a longer amount of time to upgrade an ICE car to get a half-second reduction in 0-60 mph times.\nTesla’s paid Acceleration Boost opens up a new frontier for Tesla. The electric car maker could utilize such offers to boost its revenue, especially since rolling out such features require very little cost on Tesla’s part. It could, in a way, even be the start of an era where Tesla becomes a company that follows a software-as-a-service model.\nYou can watch Quantrillous Montgomery’s video of his Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive vehicle performing after this purchase of the Acceleration Boost upgrade below.\nTesla Model 3 does 0-60 mph in 3.48 seconds after Acceleration Boost upgrade\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

Police in Westport, Connecticut, have since added a Tesla Model 3 .\nFor those not familiar with Teslas, this car is just different. There is no key. The vehicle comes to life after it connects with the drivers phone. The doors unlock by themselves. The seats adjust automatically.\nBig changes for Bargersville: And big opportunities\nTheres no dashboard. No speedometer, odometer or oil-pressure gauge. There are no dials or buttons to control the heat, air conditioning, wipers or defroster.\nAlmost everything the driver needs is controlled and displayed on a large touch-screen computer tablet mounted to the right of the steering wheel.\nA police radio, computer and other electronics that make this a patrol car are mounted on the center console, near the big, iPad-like tablet.\nCosts less\nOne might think a fancy, all-electric vehicle would cost way more than a gasoline-powered cruiser, but not so fast. Bertram said the savings in fuel and maintenance more than even out over time.\nAt $39,500, the Tesla costs about $14,500 more than one of the departments Dodge Chargers, Bertram said. The Tesla doesnt need gas and never needs an oil change, so it costs less to operate.\nBertram crunched the numbers when he convinced town leaders that the Tesla would save money.\nAnd so far, Bertram said, it has.\nIn fuel alone, he said the Tesla costs taxpayers about $300 a month less than a gas-guzzling Charger.\nThe department projected itll spend $1,728 per year on electricity for the Tesla, compared to $7,125 per year on gas for a Dodge Charger.\nOver six years, Bargersville believes the Teslas lower maintenance and fuel costs will save about $21,000 compared to a Charger.\nEvery penny counts in this growing community with just 12 officers and 14 vehicles on its police force.\nBargersvilles population exploded between 2005 and 2011. In 2019, the town added 167 single-family home building permits.\nMore growth is expected when Ind. 37 becomes I-69 linking Martinsville to Indianapolis. Bargersville is getting a large interchange when the new highway opens.\n\"I need to hire a couple guys at least in the next couple years,\" Bertram said. \"So the goal was to have a few Teslas that would reduce the amount of use in the budget so we could put that back in and pay for their salaries.\"\nBattery life\nThe downside to the Tesla is its battery, which needs to be recharged about every 250 miles. Teslas website says the Model 3s battery range is 322 miles under optimal conditions.\nThis summer, Bertram said he was getting about 240 miles per charge in the Tesla, but that range dropped to about 170 miles in the winter when he needed to use the heater.\nAnd you cant just fill up the tank like in a gas vehicle. When the battery drains, it takes about five hours to recharge.\nThat battery life was a problem recently for police in Fremont, California. In September, an officer driving a Tesla Model S had to drop out of a police chase because his battery was nearly depleted, according to the East Bay Times .\n\"I am down to six miles of battery on the Tesla so I may lose it here in a sec,\" Officer Jesse Hartman said over the police radio, according to the paper. \"If someone else is able, can they maneuver into the number one spot?\"\nThe chase was soon called off for traffic safety reasons, the paper reported. The officer in the Tesla was stranded. He didnt have enough juice to return to the station.\n“I’ve got to try to find a charging station for the Tesla so I can make it back to the city,” Hartman said over the police radio, the East Bay Times reported.\nBertram said range is not an issue in his town of just 18 square miles.\nHe starts the day with a full charge. One glance at the Teslas display lets him know exactly how much power is left. When IndyStar rode with him on a recent winter day, Bertram was about halfway through his 12-hour shift when his Teslas battery was at 64%.\nExtras\nThe Tesla, besides the fuel savings, comes with loads of extra features.\nIt has eight video cameras mounted around the vehicle that Bertram can use to record traffic stops.\nIt includes a \"toy box\" feature that does silly stuff, including a digital whoopee cushion that projects a fart noise from any seat in the car. Bertram told IndyStar he might use the whoopee cushion function when he transports an intoxicated person to the station.\nTheres Teslas signature auto-pilot mode that uses those cameras and other sensors to drive semi-autonomously, keeping the car in its lane and slowing down when traffic slows.\nThis autopilot system has drawn scrutiny after several recent Tesla crashes, including one on I-70 in Indiana in December that killed an Arizona woman .\nBertram said he hardly ever uses autopilot.\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-03'),

People were lining up at charging stations across the Central and South coast since Thursday, waiting hours to plug in their vehicles.\nAlthough the I-5 is back open at the Grapevine, many were still taking longer routes through Highway 101 on Friday.\nAt the Tesla charging station in Buellton, some drivers were waiting in line for two hours, and then another one to two hours to actually charge their car.\n“Both days were really terrible, the lines for charging,\" said Matthew Jacob, who stopped in Buellton on his way back to San Jose from Santa Barbara.\n“I love Tesla, but its the worst to drive during a holiday,\" said Vijay Shattha, who was heading to Mexico from San Francisco.  “Theres not enough super chargers for all these cars.”\nShattha says he had been waiting to plug in his vehicle since Thursday.\n“Every super charger thats not on the 5 was 40 cars deep yesterday. So we finally got to this one, we started running out of charge so we had to park it here, get a hotel about 10 miles away in an Uber, come back this morning, wait in line for another hour and a half, and were finally charging it.\"\nVivi Naumovski, who was on her way back to the Bay Area from L.A., was forced to reserve a last minute room with her family too.\n“We were on the road for about 10 hours and decided that we were going to stay at Ventura Beach Marriott,\" Naumovski said, adding that after 40 years of making the same trip during the Christmas holiday, this time has been the worst.\nAlison Sydney, a spokeswoman at the Santa Ynez Valley Marriott (next to the charging station in Buellton), said drivers tried booking last minute rooms Thursday night too.\n\"Weve been fully booked for the holidays, we had to turn people away,\" Sydney said.  “We have had them line up around the hotel all morning and yesterday. We have a lot of Teslas here, we have 11 charging stations.”\nAs a courtesy, Tesla was providing complimentary coffee and sandwiches to drivers as they waited their turn to plug in.\n“When you go to all the stations now, they are full,\" said Waldo Ortega, who had come in from Orange County. “What we try to do is schedule breakfast at a charge, and then lunch at a charge cause it takes us two charges to go from San Juan Capistrano to Mill Valley.\"\nOrtega also had a message for Tesla CEO, Elon Musk:\n“Musk, do a better job.”\nFor Saar Yanav, who was renting a Tesla, the trips complications were unexpected.\n“Its my first experience,\" he said. \"It wasnt the greatest.”\nSimilarly long lines were seen at the Tesla charging stations at the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo.\nArticle Topic Follows: Lifestyle\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

In 2020, Tesla is bringing to market some of those products and more.\nHere we look at 5 things Tesla is bringing to market in 2020:\n1. Tesla Model Y\nThe Model Y is likely going to become Tesla’s quickest turnaround from unveiling to production.\nThe electric crossover was unveiled in March 2019, and with Tesla being on track for “volume production” in mid-2020, it likely means that production is going to start in early 2020, less than a year after it was unveiled.\nAt the launch earlier this year, it was unveiled to mixed reviews.\nSome thought it was nothing more than a slightly bigger Model 3 with a hatch, while others figured out that’s exactly what a lot of people want.\nThe compact SUV space has been booming, and several automakers have already launched electric offerings in the space. If the success the Model 3 has been having in the mid-size sedan market is any indication, Tesla’s Model Y has the potential to quickly take over.\nThe Tesla Model Y starts at $48,000 for the Long Range version, which can get up to 300 miles of range. A dual motor all-wheel-drive version is also available for a $4,000 premium.\nWe currently expect the first deliveries to happen in February-March 2020.\n2. Tesla Model S refresh and Plaid\nWhen we first heard of the plan to refresh the Model S and Model X interior , it was in the summer of 2018, and at that time, it was planned for the following year.\nTesla ended up focusing on the Model 3 ramp-up and bringing Model Y to production.\nIt pushed back the project as Model S and Model X became less important vehicle programs, but we believe it is still in Tesla’s plans.\nThe automaker is also working on introducing its new “Plaid” tri-motor powertrain, and we believe Tesla might be planning to release both the performance improvements and the new interior at the same time.\nWe believe that Tesla is going to breathe some life into the Model S and Model X programs with a new interior and the new top performance Plaid option around the end of summer 2020.\n3. Tesla Semi\nWhen Tesla unveiled its all-electric heavy-duty truck, the Tesla Semi, in 2017, the automaker announced that it will be released in 2019.\nThe company has since delayed the all-electric truck despite having taken thousands of reservations with deposits worth between $5,000 and $20,000 each.\nEarlier this year, Tesla said that it plans for electric truck production to start “with limited volumes” in 2020.\nThe automaker has yet to confirm a production facility for the Tesla Semi. We heard rumors that Tesla plans to build the truck at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada.\nThat’s likely the case for the powertrain, at least, since all-new Tesla powertrain production happens at Gigafactory 1, but there are also other rumors going around about Tesla partnering with an outside manufacturer for the production of the body of the electric truck.\nCEO Elon Musk said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year.\nOver the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck, and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000, respectively.\nHowever, Musk said that they found opportunities to extend that range during testing, and he said that the Tesla Semi production version will have closer to 600 miles of range.\n4.

For example, vehicles may use glass to create parts of or the entirety of the roof of the vehicle in order to create an interior that feels more open to the outside world. In some instances, it is desirable for glass used in the body of a vehicle to provide noise absorption and temperature insulation characteristics. Thus, the interior of the vehicle will feel more open to the outside world, while providing noise absorption and temperature insulation characteristics.\nIn some embodiments, a glass structure for a vehicle includes an outer layer of glass and an inner layer of glass, wherein the inner layer of glass is perforated by a plurality of holes and wherein the outer layer of glass and the inner layer of glass are separated by a gap disposed between opposing surfaces of the outer layer of glass and the inner layer of glass. The perforations, layers of glass, and gap between the inner and outer layer may further be tuned for desired noise reduction characteristics, insulations properties, visual appearance, and the like.\nHere’s a drawing from Tesla’s patent application:\nNoise reduction seems to be the main feature of this new glass structure.\nChristopher Conklin, a former senior engineering manager at Tesla responsible for noise reduction in Tesla vehicles, and Hyunjun (Jay) Shin, a former intern at Tesla working on noise reduction, are both listed as inventors on the patent application.\nRosie Mottsmith, a staff engineer who previously worked on Tesla Glass, and William S. Sweney are also listed as inventors.\nTesla also claims that the glass structure would be better at regulating the temperature in the vehicles and reduce the load on the HVAC system.\nIn turn, it would improve the efficiency of the vehicles.\nAs usual, Tesla, like other companies, sometimes seeks patents on technologies that will never end up in production vehicles.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The companys solution—literally, it’s electrolytes with additives dissolved inside—works with nickel manganese cobalt compound (NMC) lithium ion batteries and other kinds.\nBatteries are a major liability in electric vehicles, both because of the upfront cost of enough batteries to power a vehicle, and concerns over expected lifespan and disposal of those batteries. Tesla has made inroads into battery lifespan over time, and the Tesla Model S was introduced almost as a rolling PR campaign for the idea of electric battery acceptance. In the wake of the controversial Chevy Volt launch in 2011, the 2012-launched Tesla Model S was faster, sleeker, and less ambivalence-inducing in general.\nRelated Story\nIn Defense of Elon Musk\n“To further progress the adoption of electric vehicles and grid energy storage applications, it is desirable to develop lithium-ion cell chemistries that offer longer lifetimes at high temperatures and high cell voltages, without significantly increasing cost,” Tesla’s new patent application says. The company says no existing patent or study matches the two-additive system it wants to patent. Tesla also says the technology it’s describing can be generalized to more than just lithium-ion batteries.\nMore From Popular Mechanics\nplay icon\nThe triangle icon that indicates to play\nIt’s key that Teslas application says “electric vehicles and grid energy storage,” too, indicating that founder and CEO Elon Musk intends to keep working on ideas like storeable solar energy. The idea is that Tesla is experimenting with combinations of two known additives in dozens of combinations of percentages in order to find high-performance two-additive formulas. The patent focuses on dioxazolones and nitrile sulfites, but the application points out that little is understood about how these and other additives work together and in specific kinds of lithium ion batteries. “[T]he identity of certain systems is often based on trial and error and cannot be predicted beforehand,” the patent says.\nExisting additives include vinylene carbonate, fluoroethylene carbonate, ethylene sulfate, and lithium difluorophosphate. The patent details choosing candidate additives from one of three groups based on chemical makeup and mixing them at different percentages ranging from .01 percent to 2.0 percent. It’s not clear if this mix-and-match formula approach will be patentable at all—this is just Tesla’s application. But the application itself could be a statement. Tesla has released its patents publicly in the past as a way to increase innovation within the electric car marketplace. This patent application is a road map for experimentation in combining additives to improve battery life.\nRelated Stories\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

(Credit: Mercedes-Benz)\nPosted on\nJanuary 3, 2020\nTesla appears poised to extend its reach into the heart of Das Auto, but it seems like Mercedes-Benz, a member of the old guard, may not be up to the task of meeting the young electric car maker’s challenge head-on. Daimler, for one, seems to be struggling in its home court, selling only 55 units of the its first all-electric SUV, the once-deemed “Tesla Killer” Mercedes-Benz EQC, since it was released in Germany.\nGerman publication Welt noted that the veteran car manufacturer is hesitant to reveal information about the EQC’s sales, but data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) revealed that there were only 19 units of the SUV that were sold in November 2019. Since the vehicle was released in the country, registrations for the vehicle have only numbered 55. It’s a painful pill to swallow, but it seems that Mercedes-Benz’s tagline for the EQC campaign, “Enjoy Electric,” is far from convincing local consumers.\nWelt aptly puts it: “The car is not only widely advertised, but has also been delivered for a few months. And at the last major e-car premiere that Germany experienced this year, numerous Tesla Model 3s drove through the area after just a few weeks. So where are the electric models from Stuttgart?”\nAccording to the same report, there are clear indications that Daimler spent a lot to ensure its market feels the presence of the Mercedes EQC. The electric SUV appears on TV spots, movie screens, and billboards. It seems like the only place where the electric Mercedes-Benz is nowhere to be found is on the country’s roads, or people’s garages.\nWhat’s happening to Daimler is only part of the bigger picture of what’s happening in the German automotive industry. As Tesla makes the most out of its momentum hoping to hurdle the last steps to finally begin construction of the Gigafactory 4 in Germany, local manufacturers seem to slide and struggle.\nGigafactory 4 will open opportunities for Tesla in Germany by first producing the Model Y crossover, which happens to be a cheaper alternative to the Mercedes-Benz EQC. Meanwhile, Daimler announced back in November that it will reduce its workforce and cut around 9,500 jobs across the globe as it switches its focus on electric cars.\nThe low sales number of the EQC might only be the tip of the iceberg. While Tesla has been setting trends and transforming the auto industry, Germany’s giants might have been caught resting on their laurels and were caught by surprise how a young company from California can slay them in the electric vehicle race.\nCars and Germany cannot be separated as more than 800,000 people depend on the industry to put food on their tables. It’s a complicated story why automotive giants such as Daimler cannot keep up with the future and just see Tesla cruise pass them.\nOne might just wonder if Mercedes cannot sell its electric SUV in its own backyard, how will its electric vehicles do in other markets that it depends on for revenue, such as China and the United States? The company has announced that it is delaying the release of the EQC in the US for another year, which does not bode well for the vehicle. As for Tesla, the game to conquer Europe begins soon with Tesla Gigafactory 4, and it has already opened the floodgates in China with the first deliveries of its mass-produced Model 3 electric sedans .\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-03'),

The US electric car manufacturer closed Q4 with a bang by raking in 16,877 registrations and led other popular brands with a total of 30,882 electric vehicle registrations in 2019.\nToyota was in a far second with 14,824 cumulative EV (electrified) registrations in the Netherlands while Kia sold 9,369 units. Hyundai and Audi were in the middle of the pack with 8,190 and 7,699 EVs sold, respectively. Nissan sold 3,925 vehicles, while BMW registered 3,616.\nLooking at the graph from EV data portal EU-EVs.com , it wasn’t an easy start for Tesla as it was trailing the competition. Registrations during Q1 were pegged at 2,747, just behind the 3,365 units of Toyota. It was the same picture for Q2 with 3,482 registrations for Tesla and 4,276 for Japanese automotive giant Toyota.\nTesla vs Other EV Manufacturers – Total Registrations 2019 in the Netherlands (Source: Eu-Evs.com)\nQ3 2019 is a different story as Tesla seemingly had a boost and left the other car brands behind. It finished first during the quarter with 7,776 units and Toyota didn’t have the grip and only had 3,593 new EVs registered.\nThe H2 2019 uptick can be attributed to the increasing Benefit-In-Kind taxes this 2020, which spells higher costs for consumers who want to get behind the wheel of a green car. The BIK doubles to 8% as the new year starts and the price threshold also goes down to 45,000 euros.\nThe Tesla Model 3 was also a big factor in the success of the brand in the country. The surge of Model 3 sales in Q4 2019 was impressive at 16,289, a big jump from the Q3 sales of 7,549. The brand sold 3,360 Model 3s during Q2 and 2,702 in Q1.\nOverall, Tesla’s numbers in the Netherlands will definitely be a factor in helping the brand meet its Q4 goal of delivering 105,000 units and its yearly guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles. The country has become the biggest market of the brand in Europe , overtaking Norway before the end of 2019.\nIn the United States, Tesla also pushed hard to close the year with CEO Elon Musk rushing back to the Fremont Tesla Delivery Center to assist with vehicle deliveries.\nLikewise, Tesla has also hit its production goal in its Gigafactory in Shanghai, rolling out 280 Made-In-China Model 3 per 10-hour shift or more than 1,500 units per week. The production is expected to ramp up as more frontline workers are added to the production line.\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-02'),

Fortunately, the electric car maker appears to be preparing for an influx of new electric car owners already, with the company expanding the Supercharger Network deeper into the Arctic Circle.\nThe Supercharger Network, which currently shows close to 16,000 Supercharging stalls worldwide at over 1,800 stations, already covers much of Europe. However, some parts of the Arctic Circle remain underserved, particularly in the northernmost regions of Sweden, Finland, and Norway. This latest expansion, which will include stations in Finnmark and Lapland , will allow electric car owners to travel with confidence even into the northernmost regions of Europe.\nThe sites that will host Tesla’s new Arctic Circle Superchargers have already been mapped by Tesla, though the electric car maker is yet to reveal if the new stations will be comprised of V3 stalls or its older V2 stations . Tesla is currently ramping its V3 network, though the majority of the company’s fast-chargers are still comprised of V2 chargers.\nThe expansion of the Supercharger Network further into the Arctic Circle is indicative of Tesla’s efforts to saturate the globe with a convenient system of  rapid chargers for electric cars. The Supercharger Network is already notable for its speed and its reach, and in the United States, at least, it is really the only fast-charging infrastructure that can offer electric car owners a solid way to cross the country without much delays or difficulties. This is especially true with the advent of the V3 Superchargers , which have a peak output of 250 kW or 1,000 mph.\nIn a way, Tesla’s expansion into the Arctic bodes well for electric car owners in Europe’s northernmost regions. Teslas, after all, have proven popular in the region, thanks to their practicality and performance. The Model 3, for one, has become so popular in the Netherlands that it actually beat the Volkswagen Polo to become the country’s most popular car , electric or otherwise. The same is true for Norway, another country that has embraced the Model 3 fully.\nTesla has reached a point where it is gaining the capability to saturate the market with high-volume vehicles like the Model 3. The Model Y, which is coming next year, is expected to far outsell the Model 3, resulting in an even larger number of new electric car owners, most of whom will require a stable charging infrastructure for extended trips. For these needs, Tesla’s ever-growing Supercharger Network would most definitely be the answer.\nTesla extends Supercharger Networks reach deeper into the Arctic Circle\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-02');

The agency hasnt decided whether its special-crash unit will review the crash that occurred Sunday near Terre Haute, Indiana. In both cases, authorities have yet to determine whether Teslas Autopilot system was being used.\nSponsored\nNHTSA also is investigating the Connecticut crash, in which the driver told police that the car was operating on Autopilot, a Tesla system designed to keep a car in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles. Autopilot also can change lanes on its own.\nTesla has said repeatedly that its Autopilot system is designed only to assist drivers, who must still pay attention and be ready to intervene at all times. The company contends that Teslas with Autopilot are safer than vehicles without it, but cautions that the system does not prevent all crashes.\nEven so, experts and safety advocates say a string of Tesla crashes raises serious questions about whether drivers have become too reliant on Teslas technology and whether the company does enough to ensure that drivers keep paying attention. Some critics have said its past time for NHTSA to stop investigating and to take action, such as forcing Tesla to make sure drivers pay attention when the system is being used.\nNHTSA has started investigations into 13 Tesla crashes dating to at least 2016 in which the agency believes Autopilot was operating. The agency has yet to issue any regulations, though it is studying how it should evaluate similar “advanced driver assist” systems.\n“At some point, the question becomes: How much evidence is needed to determine that the way this technology is being used is unsafe?\" said Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety in Washington. “In this instance, hopefully these tragedies will not be in vain and will lead to something more than an investigation by NHTSA.\"\nLevine and others have called on the agency to require Tesla to limit the use of Autopilot to mainly four-lane divided highways without cross traffic. They also want Tesla to install a better system to monitor drivers to make sure theyre paying attention all the time. Teslas system requires drivers to place their hands on the steering wheel. But federal investigators have found that this system lets drivers zone out for too long.\nTesla plans to use the same cameras and radar sensors, though with a more powerful computer, in its fully self-driving vehicles. Critics question whether those cars will be able to drive themselves safely without putting other motorists in danger.\nDoubts about Teslas Autopilot system have long persisted. In September, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation accidents, issued a report saying that a design flaw in Autopilot and driver inattention combined to cause a Tesla Model S to slam into a firetruck parked along Interstate 405 in Culver City in January 2018. The board determined that the driver was overly reliant on the system and that Autopilots design let him disengage from driving for too long.\nIn addition to the deaths on Sunday night, three U.S. fatal crashes since 2016 — two in Florida and one on U.S. 101 in Mountain View — involved vehicles using Autopilot.\nDavid Friedman, vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports and a former acting NHTSA administrator, said the agency should have declared Autopilot defective and sought a recall after a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a driver. Neither Teslas system nor the driver had braked before the car went underneath a semi-trailer that had turned in front of the car.\n“We dont need any more people getting hurt for us to know that there is a problem and that Tesla and NHTSA have failed to address it,\" Friedman said.\nIn addition to NHTSA, states can regulate autonomous vehicles, though many have decided they want to encourage testing.\nIn the 2016 crash, NHTSA closed its investigation without seeking a recall. Friedman, who was not at NHTSA at the time, said the agency determined that the problem didnt happen frequently. But he said that argument has since been debunked.\nFriedman said its foreseeable some drivers will not pay attention to the road while using Autopilot, so the system is defective.\n“The public is owed some explanation for the lack of action,” he said. “Simply saying theyre continuing to investigate — that line has worn out its usefulness and its credibility.”\nIn a statement, NHTSA said it relies on data to make decisions, and if it finds any vehicle poses an unreasonable safety risk, “the agency will not hesitate to take action.” NHTSA also has said it doesnt want to stand in the way of technology given its life-saving potential.\nMessages were left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla.\nRaj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said its likely that the Tesla in Sundays California crash was operating on Autopilot, which has become confused in the past by lane lines. He speculated that the lane line was more visible for the exit ramp, so the car took the ramp because it looked like a freeway lane. He also suggested that the driver might not have been paying close attention.\n“No normal human being would not slow down in an exit lane,” he said.\nIn April, Musk said he expected to start converting the companys electric cars to fully self-driving vehicles in 2020 to create a network of robotic taxis to compete against Uber and other ride-hailing services.\nAt the time, experts said the technology isnt ready and that Teslas camera and radar sensors werent good enough for a self-driving system. Rajkumar and others say additional crashes have proved that to be true.\nMany experts say theyre not aware of fatal crashes involving similar driver-assist systems from General Motors, Mercedes and other automakers. GM monitors drivers with cameras and will shut down the driving system if they dont watch the road.\nKQED\nStay in touch.

Engineering Explained isn’t so sure.\nIn a new video from the always-entertaining and educational YouTube channel, all the important numbers that go into launching a car off the line are crunched. The result may upset and surprise the Tesla faithful.\nadvertisement scroll to continue\nLet The Debate Begin: Top Gear Pits Porsche Taycan Turbo S Against Tesla Model S Performance\nFirst and foremost, we get to see which of the two electric sedans has more wheel torque. On paper, the Taycan Turbo S’s rear electric motor delivers 610 Nm (449 lb-ft) of torque while the front electric motor churns out 440 Nm (324 lb-ft). By comparison, the Tesla Model S Performance is good for 720 Nm (531 lb-ft) at the rear and 420 Nm (309 lb-ft) at the front.\nHowever, things aren’t that simple as to get an accurate wheel torque figure, you need analyze the gear ratios. When you do this it’s revealed that the Taycan Turbo S has 13,035 Nm (9,614 lb-ft) of wheel torque compared to the Tesla’s 10,925 Nm (8,057 lb-ft).\nThe next thing to look at is the wheel and tire specifications of the two cars. The 21-inch rims of the Porsche feature much wider tires than the Tesla, measuring 265 mm at the front and 305 mm at the rear compared to the 245 mm front and 265 mm rear tires of the Tesla.\nThe final two calculations relate to the respective weights of the two cars as well as their torque curves.

The company claims that today’s electric vehicles have an incomplete infrastructure, inadequate range, and cost-prohibitive for the average consumer, which became the inspiration for the “HyperHybrid” powertrain solution : a platform for those looking to make a positive impact on the environment, but without spending a lot of money. To accomplish this, Tesla Model 3’s ~50 kWh battery pack based on the latest 2170 cells is replaced with a smaller 17.3 kWh battery pack of older 18650 cells for considerable weight savings over the factory pack. A two-cylinder petrol engine is added to the vehicle’s front trunk and together with the replacement lithium-ion battery, Obrist boasts maximum energy efficiency and unmatched compactness and pricing.\nAt a cost of $2231.90 for the 17.3 kWh system and $1,339.14 for the engine, the system’s total price comes to be $3,571.04, or around 55% cheaper than the cost of a 50 kWh battery pack module.\nObrist signed its first license agreement for the car in October and expects to have a second deal done within the near future. The company located on Lake Constance in Austria plans to have its first HyperHybrid car available for public purchase in 2023. A prototype has already been in Germany for testing alongside a BMW i3. An exact name for the car has not been released by company founder Frank Obrist.\nWhile it is an interesting concept to modify a Tesla Model 3 by replacing the battery with a smaller and lighter module and adding a small engine in the frunk, the idea defeats the purpose of buying a Tesla altogether. Many Tesla owners purchased their vehicles to avoid buying gas and fight the global climate crisis. However, adding the gas motor to the vehicle defeats both of these advantages and eliminates the environmental positives that driving a Tesla has to offer. The real question is: Why fix what isn’t broken?\nTesla Model 3 gets bizarre battery pack “downgrade” and hybrid engine conversion by engineering firm\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-05'),

As 2019 ended, Motoring publication Edmunds listed some of the past year’s biggest highlights in the auto industry. And as it turned out, a number of these highlights came from Silicon Valley-based electric car maker Tesla.\nEdmunds recognized several of Tesla’s milestones in 2019, starting with its out-of-the-box all-electric pickup truck, the Cybertruck. The company’s current headliner, the Model 3, was also recognized for being the best in its class. Lastly, the motoring publication also gave some kudos to Tesla for being arguably the only mainstream carmaker that is able to push out performance improvements to its vehicles through an over-the-air update .\nEdmunds began its recognition of Tesla with the Cybertruck’s unique design and appearance, which is easily the vehicle’s most polarizing feature. The truck’s design was inspired by the vehicles in the 1982 film Blade Runner , which were created by legendary sci-fi concept artist Syd Mead. Despite its unorthodox design and CEO Elon Musk stating the truck would not be for everyone, the all-electric pickup was still able to obtain over 250,000 reservations shortly after its unveiling in November.\nAs we finally say goodbye to 2019 and a #HappyNewDecade , there were actually a few things from 2019 we are thankful for:\n1/ The Cybertruck, for changing global perceptions on what a truck could be. pic.twitter.com/zG77tRXslu\n— Edmunds (@edmunds) December 31, 2019\nThe Cybertruck will be available in three different variants. A Single Motor RWD version starting at $39,900, a Dual Motor AWD variant at $49,900, and a top-tier Tri-Motor AWD version at $69,900. The Dual Motor AWD and Tri-Motor AWD trims will begin production in late 2021, with the Single Motor RWD not entering the build phase until the following year in 2022.\nEdmunds also recognized the Model 3 for being “quite simply the best EV you can buy.” The car’s striking popularity around the world combined with its affordable price and its vast array of available variants make it one of the most well-rounded cars out there, electric or otherwise. In the past, Edmunds has been vocal about its support and inclination to recognize the Model 3 as a great car, recently naming it its “2020 EV of the Year.”\n6/ Tesla for sending updates over-the-air that demonstrably improved our 3-year-old Model 3 –– making it not only quicker, but a better drive than a brand-new BMW 3 Series. pic.twitter.com/6uqO5r66rj\n— Edmunds (@edmunds) December 31, 2019\nTesla continues to improve the Model 3 through the numerous OTA updates. Most recently, Tesla added Full Self Driving visualization features to its vehicles through an OTA update. Tesla also recently rolled out a paid $2,000 Acceleration Boost upgrade that improved the 0-60 mph time of the Model 3 Dual Motor AWD by a half second. This type of update allows owners to access additional horsepower without having to buy a new car, or spend a massive amount of money on aftermarket parts. The update is simply downloaded to the car like an application on a smartphone.\nOverall, Edmunds appears to be happy with Tesla and recognizes the company as a key player in the evolution of transportation. As the world begins to move toward sustainable options, Tesla pushes the automotive sector into battery and electric-powered options a little more every day by appealing to the masses with constantly-improving vehicles.\nTesla Cybertruck and Model 3 recognized by Edmunds as auto industry highlights of 2019\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-02'),

Tesla has been widely criticized for the simple and angular design adopted by the Cybertruck that makes it look unlike any other Tesla or pickup truck on the market. The body itself is made from a special stainless steel exoskeleton that lacks any paint, seemingly in an effort from the carmaker to slash costs and price the truck competitively to ICE-powered alternatives.\nThree variations of Cybertruck will be offered. Sitting at the base of the range will be a single motor rear-wheel drive example priced at $39,900. One step up in the range will bring customers to the mid-tier Dual Motor AWD version priced from $49,900.

A team of architects from Russia may have dreamt up the perfect home for the most diehard of Tesla enthusiasts—a hulking residential structure inspired by Elon Musk’s latest game-changing vehicle.\nSt. Petersburg-based Modern House’s latest design is the Cyberhouse, a concrete-and-steel bunker that takes its style cues from the futuristic Cybertruck. Not only is the home a perfect aesthetic match for the electric pickup, but the firm also claims it will be tough enough to withstand a nuclear war or a zombie apocalypse.\n“It is a self-sufficient multi-level bunker designed for living in a range of extreme conditions, from a Z Day to nuclear fallout,” the firm wrote in a press release.\nResembling a spaceship hangar out of a movie, the Cyberhouse’s two levels feature 3,230-square-feet of living space and can comfortably house up to seven adults, according to Modern House. While it’s unclear exactly what the interior looks like, it will feature an atrium with a subterranean parking space for the Cybertruck accessible by elevator. Meanwhile, the structure’s angular exterior is made of concrete encased in heavy-duty steel, has doors that act as airlocks and is equipped with armored windows to protect from any potential threats.\nRight now, there are currently no plans to build the Cyberhouse, but that could always change. Autoblog reports that Modern House has received several inquiries about the design since it was unveiled last week.\nWATCH\nIf the Cyberhouse were to be built, it wouldn’t be the first Cyberruck-inspired structure to go from concept to reality. Within days of debuting its Cybunker concept earlier this month, New York-based design firm Lars Büro announced plans to put its futuristic garage into production . While the Cybertruck won’t be available until 2021 at the earliest, specs, pricing and availability details for the dedicated garage are expected to be announced early next year.\nRead More On:\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-30'),

The terrain was rocky, but fertile; full of opportunity, if you could make it through the technical and consumer crags.\nNow, 10 years later, things look different. Established car companies like General Motors and Porsche are elbowing for their share alongside startups like Rivian and Byton . But one company is inarguably both the trailblazer and master of EVs: Elon Musk’s Tesla.\nIn the first half of the decade, headlines frequently predicted doom for the fledgling company. When any new all-electric vehicle idea came out, critics were quick to anoint it with the label “Tesla killer,” no matter car type, range, or level of luxury. Those labels didn’t stick, however: Tesla is still alive and well. In fact, is \"affordable\" sedan, the Model 3, made up an eighth of all EV sales worldwide this year. It dominates.\nAs the decade comes to a close and the EV market is poised to get even more crowded in 2020 and beyond, here’s a look back at “Tesla killers” that never materialized. Better luck next decade.\nFaraday Future\nThe ill-fated electric Faraday Future FF91. Credit: FREDERIC J. BROWN / AFP via Getty Images\nStalling can happen to electric cars, too.\nWhen Faraday Future unveiled its FF91 at CES in 2017 to much fanfare and fandom , it said its luxury electric vehicle would go into production in 2018. That never happened. Instead, the EV startup burned billions in cash, scrapped plans for production facilities, gone through layoffs, furloughs , re-structuring , and saw its (now former) CEO declare bankruptcy and hide from his Chinese debtors. Oh, and it still has yet to produce a car.\nNewly instated CEO Carsten Breitfeld promises that FF91 cars will go into production and hit the road by fall 2020 . Faraday Future *could* still pull that off if it’s able to line up new financing . But as a supposed Tesla killer of the 2010s, FF remains a failure.\nJaguar E-Type\nThe E-Type remains a classic. Credit: Jaguar\nA classic redefined . That was the hype of Jaguars 1960s sports car revived as an all-electric beauty. For car collectors, Jaguar had big plans to convert original models into electric machines. Instead the E-Type overhaul was scrapped just over a year after it was first announced. What happened?\nWell, it wasnt completely killed. As Electrek reported , Jaguar hopes to one day revive the E-Type as an electric vehicle. \"One day,\" as in not anytime soon.\nWith Jaguars electric I-Pace already delivering to customers, the E-Type seemed liked a fun side project that could lean on the established battery production behind the brands first all-electric SUV.\nGoing electric is hard.\nFisker Karma (and EMotion)\nThe Fisker Karma was short-lived. Credit: JONATHAN NACKSTRAND / AFP / GettyImages\nThe death of Fiskers supercar isn’t as cut and dry as the haters would like. Yes, the Fisker Karma was going to be the luxury electric vehicle of the decade. But only 2,450 of the cars were ever made after its 2011 launch. After battery issues with the plug-in sports car led to recalls and financial problems galore (the battery supplier filed for bankruptcy and then Fisker Automotive filed as well) the company pulled the plug.\nThe company is still chugging along with an all-electric SUV, the Fisker Ocean , set for unveiling in January and production starting in 2021. The luxury sedan EMotion first revealed in 2017 is delayed , so dont expect that until well after the Ocean starts delivery. The EMotion was supposed to arrive around now.\nAs car designer Henrik Fisker told Mashable back in 2016, \"...it is important to keep going, despite the naysayers.\"\nDyson EV\nWell always have the UK Patent Office diagrams of the Dyson electric vehicle that never happened. Credit: DYSON\nThe cruel mistress that is economics dashed our dreams about future EV advertisements narrated by the soothing voice of Sir James Dyson.\nIn 2017, the world learned that the sleek vacuum, air filter, and other household product company was turning its attention to electric vehicles. The possibility was exciting: Dyson would be a newcomer to the EV space, but it already had brand recognition, engineering chops, and a strong aesthetic, which all couldve potentially given Tesla a run for its money.\nUnfortunately, the Dyson EV was not to be. Dyson announced this fall that it had put the kibosh on its EV project. It stood by the work itself, saying that the decision was \"not a product failure.\" Instead, the choice was an economic one: Dyson killed the project after determining that manufacturing an EV was not commercially viable. Even for a brand like Dyson, by 2019, the EV market was just too hard to crack.\nNio\nA NIO ES8 electric SUV in happier times. Credit: Visual China Group via Getty Images\nNio was flying high as the top dog in the Chinese EV scene. Then suddenly this year, things started crumbling : losses were mounting; it shut down its San Francisco office; it fired 20 percent of employees; and finally it recalled one of its electric SUVs.\nOne of its three cars available, the ES8 SUV, was recalled after three battery fires. Its four upcoming models now face more of a challenge just to take off.\nThe company is only five years old, but has been compared to Tesla constantly. The ES8 was hailed as a more affordable Tesla Model X. Now? Not so much.\nChevy Volt\nChevrolet Volt was like a poor mans hybrid Tesla. Credit: Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images\nNot to be confused with the thriving all-electric Chevy Bolt, the Chevy Volt (with a v!) is done for. Despite a strong community that rallied around the plug-in hybrid that first emerged at the start of the decade, Chevy discontinued the Volt this year. General Motors sold as many as 155,000 Volts during its tenure.\nEven with an internal combustion engine to quell any range anxiety, the Volt was too much of a sedan in a market where everyone wants an SUV or a luxury long-range sedan. Its all-electric sibling (cousin?), the Bolt, has enough range (about 240 miles) to keep drivers calm and snag buyers looking for a smaller vehicle.\nThe confusion alone between the similarly named Bolt and Volt pretty much determined there was only space for one single-syllable EV from GM.\nMore in Electric Vehicles , Tesla\nSasha Lekach\nSasha is a news writer at Mashables San Francisco office.

On a Tesla there are various reboots from soft to hard, some that can be configured while driving, and others that risk \"bricking,\" or shutting down the computer system for good. Reddit Tesla pages and Tesla forums are filled with advice to restart your car and force it to work, dammit!\nOne poster lists four different ways to reboot:\n1) Hold down both scroll wheels - reboots the touchscreen, This corrects problems with navigation, backup camera, and the infotainment system. This can be done while driving.\n2) Hold down both buttons over the scroll wheel. This reboots the instrument cluster. It corrects some problems with the IC, but I dont recall which ones. This can also be done while driving albeit you briefly lose the instrument cluster information.\n3) Hold down both buttons over the scroll wheel while pressing the brake pedal. This is a deeper reboot than the previous one. Obviously, you cant do this while driving.\n4) Power down the car and turn it back on. This is done with the e-Brake power off setting from the touch screen. Wait two minutes and then press the brake pedal to turn the car back on. This procedure actually removes power from parts of the car and can correct hardware glitches, for example a non-functioning Autopilot camera.\nFor some drivers, the latest holiday update hasnt even popped up on their screens yet.

Otherwise the seats are fantastically comfortable and have the easiest accessible third row of any SUV. The second row very conveniently moves forward and tilts on an electric single post. A winner!\nIt’s not a pretty car. Front-on is ugly, the side and quarter views are better, with a strong rear-end.\nI ticked the option for the stereo upgrade, and along with the free Spotify subscription you get for life, you will rediscover music of your youth, and endless new music of today. The Comedy channels are great - all free. It does need Apple CarPlay though.\nThis Model X is the best handling large SUV out there. Nothing can come close to it. It’s a simple physics exercise; if you remove the 250-350kg internal combustion engine and transmission from above the axle, and you replace it with a perfectly distributed 800kg battery pack that rests at or BELOW the axle height, with a fantastic all-wheel drive system and fat tyres, its going to run rings around a BMW X5.\nDuring the 207,000kms it’s covered, the car has gone into “limp mode” five times. With Tesla not having an extensive dealership network, this lack of service centres can be scary, but on four occasions, a phone call to the 24/7 help desk (who are able to carry out a full remote diagnosis of the car) has seen the fault rectified and had me sent on my way.\nThis is a free of charge service for life! I asked the local Service Boss why Tesla doesn’t charge for this rectification procedure. He responded that it’s counter-intuitive for Tesla to charge a client for something that has gone wrong on the vehicle if they can design it in the first place to be fixed remotely!\nThis, coupled with the fact that there are no scheduled services needed for a Tesla, allows you to quickly get back the premium you spend on the vehicle in the first place.\nThe one time the car couldn’t be remotely rectified only happened because a front engine bolt failed, dropping the engine enough to twist the main shaft, and damaging the motor beyond repair.\nThe two motors and battery are covered by an 8-year unlimited kilometre warranty, and the replacement was supplied and fitted within a week! Fantastic outcome.\nThe battery has stood up well, having only lost 25 kilometres of range since new. This is highly comparable to the loss of efficiency that any internal combustion car would experience.\nDuring my time owning this car, it has had numerous updates and upgrades pushed through the “over the air updates” that Tesla provides free-of-charge for the life of the car. It’s constantly being made relevant, rather than superseded like what other brands enforce on their older fleet.\nI’m waiting for a full main screen and ECU upgrade early next year, which will allow it to progress from level 2 autonomous driving to level 4.\nI had been brought up with - and have operated - very high-mileage 6 and 8-cylinder cars over three decades. The Tesla, and the ecosystem that you will discover once owning one, will quickly pay you dividends and convince you it’s the best urban SUV money can buy.\n*to secure free energy from Tesla, make use of this link to a referral discount when accessing the online design studio.\nView 6 images\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

But there are several different kinds of jet engines, depending on how they operate. You frequently hear about ramjets, scramjets, and even turbojets. But there is another kind — a very old kind — called a pulsejet. [Integza] shows how he made one using 3D printed parts and also has a lot of entertaining background information. You can see the video below. (Beware, there is a very little bit of off-color language and humor in the video, so you might not want to watch this one at work.)\nThey are not ideal from a performance standpoint, but they are easy to make. How easy? A form of pulsejet was accidentally discovered by a young Swiss boy playing with alcohol in the early 1900s. Because of their simplicity, they’ve been built by lots of different people, including rocket pioneer Robert Goddard, who mounted one to a bicycle.\nTesla — the inventor, not the car — invented a lot of things, including a one-way valve design with no moving parts. A pulsejet expels exhaust and intakes air through the same hole, so good ones use a one-way valve. Tesla’s is interesting because it is nothing more than a shaped channel that has low resistance to flow in one direction and higher resistance in the other direction. The trick is in a teardrop shape that is thin on the inlet side and fat on the outlet side. It isn’t perfect, but it does provide a basic and mechanically reliable one way action.\nThe biggest problem, of course, with a 3D printed jet engine is that the engine gets hot and plastic likes to melt. [Integza] used lost PVA casting with plaster which worked well. There were still plastic parts melting, though. He used a high tech PLA, but we wondered if PETg or nylon would have been better choices for heat resistance.\nIt took several iterations, but he finally got some pretty impressive results. Well, impressive when you consider what he’s working with. We aren’t sure you’d ever want to use a 3D printed pulsejet in an actual project, but if models like this help you understand the principles, it might lead to a more practical engine somewhere down the road.\nIf you think Goddard’s bicycle idea was cool, here’s a more recent attempt . If a bicycle isn’t your thing, a jet sled is a possibility . We’ve seen other attempts to make jets with at least some 3D printed parts .\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

In traditional learning systems, the captured sensor data is made compatible with a deep learning system by converting the captured data from a sensor format to a format compatible with the initial input layer of the learning system. This conversion may include compression and down-sampling that can reduce the signal fidelity of the original sensor data. Moreover, changing sensors may require a new conversion process. Therefore, there exists a need for a customized data pipeline that can maximize the signal information from the captured sensor data and provide a higher level of signal information to the deep learning network for deep learning analysis.”\nTesla describes its solution in the patent application:\n“A data pipeline that extracts and provides sensor data as separate components to a deep learning network for autonomous driving is disclosed. In some embodiments, autonomous driving is implemented using a deep learning network and input data received from sensors. For example, sensors affixed to a vehicle provide real-time sensor data, such as vision, radar, and ultrasonic data, of the vehicle’s surrounding environment to a neural network for determining vehicle control responses. In some embodiments, the network is implemented using multiple layers. The sensor data is extracted into two or more different data components based on the signal information of the data. For example, feature and/or edge data may be extracted separate from global data such as global illumination data into different data components. The different data components retain the targeted relevant data, for example, data that will eventually be used to identify edges and other features by a deep learning network. In some embodiments, the different data components function as containers that store data highly relevant for identifying certain targeted features but do not themselves identify or detect the features. The different data components extract data to ensure accurate feature detection at an appropriate stage of a machine learning network. In some embodiments, the different data components may then be pre-processed to enhance the particular signal information that they contain. The data components can be compressed and/or down-sampled to increase resource and computational efficiency. The different data components are then provided to the deep learning system at different layers of the system.\nThe deep learning network is able to accurately identify and detect the features associated with the targeted data (e.g., edges, objects, etc.) of the data component using the signal information retained during extraction as input. For example, feature and edge data is provided to the first layer of the network and global data to a later layer of the network. By extracting different data components that each retain their respective targeted signal information, the network more efficiently processes the sensor data. Instead of receiving the sensor data as an initial input to the network, the network is provided with the most useful information at the most appropriate layer of the network. In some embodiments, a more complete version of the captured sensor data is analyzed by the network since the different data components can fully utilize the image resolution of their respective components for their intended purposes. For example, input for features and edges can utilize the entire resolution, bit range, and bit depth for feature and edge data whereas input for global illumination can utilize the entire resolution, bit range, and bit depth for global illumination data.”\nInterestingly, two of the three engineers who are listed as inventors on the patent, Brijesh Tripathi and Timofey Uvarov, are not working at Tesla anymore.\nIntel for Tripathi and Pony.Ai for Uvarov.\nAs for the third engineer, Evgeny Fainstain, it’s not clear if he is still at Tesla.\nHere’s the full patent application from Tesla:\n[scribd id=441072526 key=key-Mao5JoLi07Oi5n3bjffX mode=scroll]\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The 992-pound vehicle is able to put out 603 horsepower (450kw), according to Electrek , which, for a go-kart-sized car, is pretty darn fast.\nRecommended Videos\nThe vehicle made its debut at the Sydney EV Expo last month. YouTuber BrunoPoweeer (whose real name is Bruno Bari Buccianti) got to see the car up close during the expo and posted a video to his YouTube channel about it.\nThe team behind the electric go-kart mounted the Tesla Drive Unit upside down, which was able to improve the overall handling of the vehicle. The batteries of the car are on the left side, which balances out the weight of the driver on the right side.\nAside from a Tesla engine, the go-kart also contains a 400 V LiPo battery, an EV control unit, and a dashboard touchscreen. Butcher said that the vehicle took three weeks to make.\n“We’ve probably over-engineered it a little more than we needed to in the event that we end up doing normal track runs. It will spend most of its life racing in hill climbs, hence remove as much weight as we actually can,” Butcher told Buccianti in the video.\nOverall, it cost about $100,000 to build the Tesla-run race car, so you’re probably better off with the much cheaper $40,000 Tesla Cybertruck.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck in November. While not everyone has responded positively to the truck’s futuristic-looking style, its specs are definitely impressive for an electric truck. It has seating for up to six, an onboard air compressor, a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds, a range between 250 to 500 miles depending on the model, and semi-autonomous technology.\nSome diehard Tesla fans even want to see a Lego version of the Cybertruck . One Lego Ideas user has received 7,000 out of the 10,000 supporters needed for a proposed Lego Cybertruck model.

He left soon thereafter for Princeton University and in 1912, he married Janet Pomeroy Avery, an Auburn native and relative of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. After Dulles’ father died in 1930, his mom sold their house at 67 South Street to the state of New York. The house served as the residence of the Warden for the Auburn Correctional Facility for more than 60 years.\nElizabeth Koenig and her husband Dr. Paul were the first private owners of the Dulles mansion. They put the home up for sale in 2018 for $599,000. They spent about five years doing renovations and restoration projects with the property.

Without his mind and creativity as a designer, we would never have seen the Cybertruck become a reality.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk used Mead’s ideas for vehicles in the 1982 film Blade Runner as inspiration for his company’s newest release of the Cybertruck. Following the news of Mead’s passing yesterday, Musk tweeted, “Rest in peace Syd Mead. Your art will endure.” This tweet from Musk was met with responses from followers who shared their appreciation for Mead’s futuristic-themed artwork, especially considering it was a direct inspiration for the pickup that Tesla will begin producing in late 2021.\nCredit: sydmead.com\nCredit: sydmead.com\nCredit: sydmead.com\nMead and Musk, two minds that have led their respective industries, had tremendous amounts of respect for one another. When Tesla finally unveiled the truck in late November , Mead stated the truck was “stylistically breathtaking” and said he was flattered by Tesla’s use of his design for their newest product. This was obviously a compliment to Musk who shared Mead’s comments on the Cybertruck on his Twitter with a series of heart emojis by his name.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 23, 2019\nMead was born in 1933 and notes his father’s pulp magazines like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon as being the inspiration for his inspiration in science-fiction. He graduated high school in Colorado and after a three-year stint with the U.S. Army and a degree from Art Center School in Los Angeles, Mead accepted a position with Ford Motor Company in its Advanced Styling Studio.\nAfter a lengthy career in the corporate world providing illustrations and designs for an extensive array of companies, he began working with movie studios on films like Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Bladerunner, Tron, and even worked with Star Wars director George Lucas to develop the All Terrain Armored Transport or AT-AT. Mead lost his three-year battle to a type of blood cancer known as lymphoma. Elon Musk was sure to give his condolences to the man who ultimately was the inspiration behind the design of the Cybertruck.\nRest in peace Syd Mead. Your art will endure.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 30, 2019\nWhen the Cybertruck design was speculated about by electric vehicle enthusiasts, Tesla’s Elon Musk stated the truck was even more “Blade Runner-Esque” than designs and renders suggested. The truck’s futuristic shape and design were meant to be different than anything that was available to consumers today, and it is. “It doesn’t look like anything else,” Musk said at the vehicle’s unveiling event at the SpaceX Rocket Facility in Los Angeles.\nMead’s passing is unfortunate, but as fans of Tesla’s work, we should all be grateful that the man who designed some of the inspirations for the truck had the opportunity to see it before he left Earth. His work with science fiction films is impressive and his passion for his work has evidently led to other’s feeling inspired by it. “I’ve called science fiction ‘reality ahead of schedule,” Mead said in a 2011 interview with the New York Times.\nTesla Cybertruck: Elon Musk pays year-end tribute to Blade Runner artist that inspired it all\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-31'),

But they worry about battery range and reliability. Tesla\n1\nLOS ANGELES — And now for something completely different.\nA Los Angeles Auto show that started with a Ford Mustang Mach-E electric crossover taking on the Tesla Model Y, ended with Tesla in its familiar position: introducing a vehicle unlike any seen before.\nThe Tesla Cybertruck pickup caught the automotive world by surprise with its daring sci-fi design, segment-busting performance figures and competitive $39,000 starting price. Conversations with Metro Detroit Ford F-150 enthusiasts indicate the Tesla has their attention. But when it comes to purchase, these users all got hung up on familiar concerns about electric vehicles.\nMore than perhaps any other vehicle, owners of pickups raise concerns about battery range and reliability compared to gas-powered mainstays.\nAdvertisement:\nDetroit auto companies these days are noticeably insecure when it comes to Silicon Valley EVs and autonomous vehicles. They, too, want to be the cool kids on the block. So Ford cheekily launched its first electric SUV, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, at LA’s Hawthorne Airport right under the nose of Tesla’s design studio. The glitzy launch event featured movie star Idris Elba interviewing Ford CEO Bill Ford. Consumers applauded.\nThen Tesla reminded everyone how it was done.\n“The Mach E was a familiar auto industry reveal,” said Tim Stevens, an auto reviewer with C-NET’s “Roadshow” who used to cover Silicon Valley electronics. “Tesla is probably 95 percent Tesla faithful in the room, emotions are very high. Musk presents the truck and all of a sudden they are hitting it with a sledgehammer. It’s a very different sort of event.”\nThe Tesla show was populated with lightning-shooting Tesla coils and screaming Tesla employees dressed in sci-fi costumes. When Musk strode on stage, says TFLTruck expert Roman Mica, he was greeted with screams of “I want to have your baby!” and “I want to marry you!” That doesn’t happen to other industry executives.\nThen things really got crazy. Musk introduced a stainless-steel triangular pickup that looked like it had come off a Hollywood sci-fi movie set. After demolishing a Ford F150 door, Tesla designer Franz Von Holzhausen turned his sledgehammer on the Cybertruck’s doors and then chucked steel balls at its windows to prove its toughness.\nAdvertisement:\nMusk infamously failed in proving the shatterproof quality of the Cybertruck’s “armored glass” – two windows yielded to steel balls – but such glass is not unknown to the industry. Ford itself was the first to use shatterproof Gorilla Glass on its Ford GT supercar.\nThe rollout was crazy, yes. But it was also an acknowledgment by Tesla that its space-age truck has to address conventional concerns valued by Detroit Three pickup owners: toughness, performance and versatility.\nFord, Chevrolet and Ram brands have ridden these attributes to dominate the biggest vehicle segment in the United States. Musk is desperate to penetrate the truck truck market to show the mass sales-potential of EVs. On the toughness front, F-150 owners I talked with were impressed by Musk’s demonstration – unconventional as it was.\nThey were well aware of the Cybertruck after Musk’s circus show. They were unfamiliar with Rivian, Bollinger and Lordstown Motors, the other electric trucks hoping to gain traction in the pickup space.\nWhen Ford introduced its aluminum-body F-150 four years ago, Chevy responded in a similar manner as Tesla: by dropping a toolbox on an F-150 truck bed and puncturing it. By contrast, the Silverado’s bed is made from rolled-steel. The Cybertruck’s skin is stainless steel.\nAdvertisement:\nMy trucker focus group liked Tesla’s macho, including claimed payload (3,500 pounds) and towing (14,000 pounds) — figures that beat the Detroit Three. At $39,000 for a rear-wheel-drive model, they liked that the Tesla was priced competitively, unlike the Rivian and Bollinger trucks that are north of $70,000.\nBut where truckers get cold feet is in the practical application of those numbers. The Ford F-150, for example, sold nearly a million copies last year because of its gas-powered versatility.\nAt TFLTruck, which tests vehicles on Colorado’s challenging landscape, Mica and his team have been testing Tesla’s Model X SUV with a claimed 4,980-pound towing capability – healthy for a mid-sized SUV. But with 2,000 pounds behind it, TFLTruck finds the Model X gets just 30 percent of its predicted 325 miles of range.\nFor an Oakland County-based construction worker commuting 100 miles to a job site in, say, Ann Arbor, that can be an issue. To an outdoorsman driving up north on a fishing trip to the Manistee River outside Grayling, the lack of charging infrastructure in rural America is concerning. For an electrician working out of his truck in winter cold at a facility without power, battery life is a worry. The concerns translate to other battery-powered trucks entering the market as well.\nThose concerns mirror the people who have tested my Tesla Model 3.\nInterestingly, my truck experts did not flinch at the Cybertruck’s styling. In fact, they found it refreshing. Technologically curious by nature, these Ford faithful were intrigued by the Tesla’s electronic wizardry. Put the Cybertruck design back-to-back with an F-150 and it looks like it arrived here from the future.\nAdvertisement:\nThat said, they balked at the Cybertruck’s steep bed sides that would make it difficult to pitch shovelfuls of mulch into an open bed. The innovative midsize Honda Ridgeline introduced a similarly innovative design in 2006 and was met with poor sales.\nAt the Cybertruck reveal, Musk’s 1976 Lotus Esprit was on display. The angular sports car, which was used in the filming of the “The Spy Who Loved Me,” helped inspire the Cybertruck’s unique looks.\nAt the Ford reveal, a picture of the 1914 Detroit Electric vehicle that Henry Ford’s wife, Clara, drove was prominently displayed. Innovative and quiet, the Detroit Electric EV failed to sell next to Ford’s popular, gas-powered Model T because it lacked range and affordability.\nConversation\nThis discussion has ended.

(Credit: Scott Kubo/YouTube)\nPosted on\nDecember 27, 2019\nTesla’s Neural Net continues to improve and become more advanced on a daily basis, but it appears that the electric car maker is making sure that it will evolve at an even faster rate in the future. A recent patent, for example, would allow Tesla’s autonomous driving systems to work more efficiently, thanks to a new data pipeline focused on optimized image processing.\nTesla’s patent for “ Data Pipeline and Deep Learning System for Autonomous Driving ” was published on December 26. The idea behind the patent is to revolutionize and improve upon past deep learning systems that have been used for autonomous driving vehicles. In the past, these systems have used “captured sensor data” to retrieve information.\nTesla recognizes the need for new sensors when data becomes more complex. According to the electric car maker’s patent, there is “a need for a customized data pipeline that can maximize the signal information from the captured sensor data and provide a higher level of signal information to the deep learning network for deep learning analysis.”\n(Credit: Tesla)\nThe system described in this patent would capture an image using any of the sensors or cameras on the vehicle. In this case, this would describe a high dynamic range camera, camera sensor, radar sensor, or ultrasonic sensor. The image would then be broken down through a “high-pass” or ‘lo-pass” filter and a series of processors would then decipher what the image means.\nThe flowchart below describes what the process of the vehicle learning the information would look like. “Receive Sensor Data” is the first portion of this process. Then, data will be broken down and pre-processed for the system to then begin its “Deep Learning Analysis.” The results will then be passed along to the vehicle’s Artificial Intelligence Processor to be utilized during vehicle control.\nCredit: U.S. Patent Office/Tesla\nIn another process, the series of information that is retrieved from these images will be compared to data compiled from other Tesla users on a global scale. This will alleviate concerns that drivers may have that the system could perform the wrong process when driving autonomously. The aim of the patent is to create a safe driving experience and improve upon the already solid performance of Tesla’s autonomous driving software, and do so in a process that is more efficient than before.\nBy using this process, Tesla is able to maintain as much resolution as possible from the images captured by its vehicles’ cameras and sensors. This then allows the Neural Network to more efficiently learn from the data packets that it is receiving. This allows the Neural Network to work with better images in a more efficient manner as well, which opens the doors to faster autonomous driving improvements. These efficiencies would work very well with the additional horsepower offered by Tesla’s Hardware 3 computer, which is specifically designed for full self-driving with built-in redundancies .\nBuilding upon the foundation that Tesla has already laid down in terms of its Full Self Driving suite, the recent patent suggests that the company is now attempting to narrow down on the finer points of its software’s performance. The addition of this patent will not only create a safer driving experience for owners of Tesla vehicles but will bring the quickly approaching future of fully-autonomous vehicles even closer to completion.\nThe full text of Tesla’s new data pipeline and deep learning patent could be viewed here .\nTeslas new data pipeline and deep learning patent paves way for quicker autonomous driving improvements\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

The battery will be integrated with Saint John Energy’s artificial intelligence control program, which will help reduce monthly peak demand.\n“This sort of large-scale battery is crucial to our power system if we want to truly deal with climate change and take full advantage of renewable energy,” said Bill Marshall, a power sector consultant and former Director of Strategic Planning with NB Power , in a blog post for Saint John Energy back in August.\nSaint John Energy will invest approximately $1.5 million on the new utility-scale battery. If the utility can save up enough off-peak energy and then use it during peak times, it says there are potential savings up to $200,000 a year. If it meets that target, the battery will pay for itself in seven-and-a-half years.\nThe battery would also play a role in the Burchill Wind Project proposed for Spruce Lake Industrial Park. At times when the wind farm doesn’t generate enough energy, the battery will supplement that with its stored clean energy.\n“Saint John Energy will be able to store clean, cheap intermittent wind power, releasing it onto the grid at peak times, when demand is greatest, such as the morning and evening rush,” said Marshall.\nRELATED: Saint John Energy Is Installing A Tesla Battery To Store Power And Save $15,000 A Month\n“Instead of combustion-fueled backup plants having to be fired up to meet peak demand, stored green energy can flow. It’s good for the environment AND the economy. Over time, there’s no doubt the battery will help lower power costs for consumers.”\nSee more photos of the huge battery below:\nImage: Saint John Energy, Facebook\nImage: Saint John Energy, Facebook\nImage: Saint John Energy, Facebook\nImage: Saint John Energy, Facebook\nShare this:\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-03');

This is intended to increase the performance and service life of the batteries as well as reducing costs.\n++ Kindly find all updates to this article below. ++\nThe new development is the work of Jeff Dahn and his Canadian laboratory who conduct battery research for Tesla. The patent specification submitted by the subsidiary Tesla Motors Canada states that the new battery systems work with “less active electrolyte additives” that can be used in various energy storage applications – “for example in vehicle and grid storage”.\nIn particular, the patent disclosure includes “additive electrolyte systems that improve the performance and life of lithium-ion batteries while reducing the cost of other systems based on more or different additives. However, the exact savings potential is not quantified, as development is not yet complete.\nThe new patent application is based on another development that Tesla filed for patent in September . At that time, it was said that the new cells could achieve 4,000 cycles at 40 degrees Celsius using NMC chemistry and an advanced electrolyte. Such cells could last for 1.6 million kilometres in an electric car or 20 years in stationary storage, according to Tesla.\nThe current patent document states that the LiIon NMC cells were manufactured with “a recently developed electrolyte additive MDO (probably the one from September, editor’s note) and two new additives PDO and BS”. “The improved systems include a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising one or more lithium salts, one or more non-aqueous solvents and an additive or additive mixture”.\nFurther development should focus on further optimising the composition of the additives, “for example by adjusting the ratio of primary and secondary additives or by introducing ternary mixtures”.\nIf Tesla were to use the patent-pending technologies to make its own battery cells ready for series production, the company would probably rely on NMC cells for its potential own battery cell production – so far, it has mainly used NCA cells. Rumour has it that NMC cells are only used in the MIC Model 3 (the model produced in China).\nAccording to earlier reports, the NCA round cells manufactured by Panasonic for the American-made Model 3 are said to have a cobalt content of 2.8 per cent. It remains to be seen what proportion the new NMC cells will have – they will still contain a certain eponymous proportion.\nUpdate 24 April 2020: After the Tesla patent for an improved battery cell with NMC chemistry, another patent for NCA chemistry is now following. A source familiar with the matter explained that the new electrodes will probably enable Tesla to achieve an energy density similar or even better than that of NMC cells. The patent application lists Dahn himself and Tesla battery engineers Hongyang Li and Jing Li, who were trained by him, as the inventors.\n', 'TSLA', '2020-01-02'),

Tesla is anticipated to provide its delivery details in the next few days.\nJed Dorsheimer of Canaccord Genuity said in a note that he expects Tesla will come in above 360,000 units. He previously estimated the company would deliver 368,965 units.\nWedbushs Daniel Ives concurs, saying Tesla should comfortably hit its 2019 outlook.\nGoing forward, Dorsheimer and Ives predict China will play a critical role in the companys growth. Tesla delivered its first batch of Model 3 cars produced in Shanghai last month.\nIves says ramping up production at Teslas factory in China and gauging demand in the region will be a primary focus for investors over the next 12 to 18 months.\nWhile Tesla has faced its share of financial worries, Dorsheimer believes those concerns will be muted this year.\n“As Tesla has secured funding for Chinas gigafactory and demonstrated increased profitability, we believe investor focus in 2020 will be squarely on the greater electrical vehicle opportunity,\" he wrote.\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

(Photo by ... [+] Frederic J. BROWN / AFP)        (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\nAs the big annual odometer teeters on the verge of rolling over to 2020, Tesla ( TSLA ) buyers who put down a $2,500 deposit (of sorts) on the upcoming Model Y crossover earlier in 2019 will likely see the New Year as a milestone towards the arrival of their new electric chariot, and a sighting posted to YouTube on Thursday should help heat up the hype for what could be earlier-than-expected summertime deliveries.\nPosted by popular YouTube denizen StevenMConroy , who has a penchant for drone videos of trains, motorcycle shenanigans and apparently spotting ultra-rare supercars , the thankfully steady-handed Conroy happened upon a glossy white pre-pro Model Y parking nose-out in San Luis Obispo. Conroy caught some great looks as he circled the Tesla, which was sporting some nice touches including a dual-motor badge, fancy new wheels and an apparent “de-chrome” treatment that made the door handles and window trims a touch more low profile. It would probably look a bit sinister in black.\nConroy calls the wheels “Power Sports Aero Wheels” but they are also known as Gemini wheels, a possible upcoming option for the Model 3 Performance, so seeing them on the close cousin Model Y should be no great surprise. Overall, the new Tesla crossover looks good, with typical (for Tesla cars at least) rounding for aerodynamics and expected features like a glass roof and retractable door handles.\nComing off the hype and shock of the Tesla Cybertruck , it’s almost refreshing to see an updated version of a “normal” Tesla that’s headed our way. The Model Y blends the chub nose of the Model 3 with the tall tail of the Model X, and it should seat seven adults (according to Tesla) although the rear two seats might best serve tall children or those that will never need to shop at the Big-N-Tall store. There are no images of the interior, so we can’t tell if this is the 7-seater, which is a $3,000 option over the usual five-place machines.\nMORE FOR YOU\n', 'TSLA', '2019-12-27'),

REUTERS/Yilei Sun/File Photo\nAdoption would mark the first time for the U.S. automaker to include so-called lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in its lineup, as it seeks to lower production costs amid faltering overall EV sales in China.\nTesla has been talking to the Chinese manufacturer for more than a year to supply LFP batteries that will be cheaper than its existing batteries by a “double-digit percent,” said a person directly involved in the matter, who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified.\nTesla Inc and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) declined to comment.\nEV manufacturers usually use nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) or nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries on passenger vehicles because of their higher energy density, which is critical in determining how far an EV can drive on single charge.\nTo boost the density and safety of its LFP batteries, CATL has been working on its so-called cell-to-pack technology, the people told Reuters.\nIt was not clear to what extent Tesla intends to use LFP batteries but the automaker has no plans to stop using its current NCA batteries, said one of the people.\nTesla has been ramping up production of its Model 3 cars at its newly built $2 billion Shanghai plant and cutting prices to win market share from conventional premium automakers such as Germanys BMW AG BMWG.DE and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE .\nTesla started to deliver cars from the factory in December, helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models. It is currently seeking regulatory approval to make longer-range Model 3 cars at the plant.\nSales in China of new energy vehicles - referring to battery-only, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles - likely sank 54.4% in January, industry data showed, due in part to the Lunar New Year holiday starting earlier than last year as well as the impact of the outbreak in China of a new coronavirus.\nThe use of LFP batteries will also help Chief Executive Elon Musk meet a 2018 promise that Tesla would cut the use of cobalt - which costs some $33,500 a tonne - to “almost nothing”.\nTesla plans to host a battery event, probably in April, to share its future battery strategy and technology, Musk said at an earnings conference in January.\nReporting by Zhang Yan, Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh; Additional reporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Christopher Cushing\n', 'TSLA', '2020-02-17'),

The 49-year-old Tesla CEO owns roughly one fifth of the electric vehicle maker’s stock, and is currently the 19th-richest person in the world. His fortune includes an estimated $12.5 billion stake in SpaceX, his privately held aerospace company known for its reusable rockets.\nOn February 13, 2020, Tesla announced it would do a secondary stock offering with the intent to raise between $2 billion and $2.31 billion at $767 a share, a roughly 5% discount to the share price before the announcement. The news came less than two weeks after Musk said in an earnings call that Tesla did not plan to raise more capital.\n“We’re spending money, I think, efficiently, and we’re not artificially limiting our progress,” Musk said during a call with analysts to discuss Tesla’s quarterly earnings. “And then, despite all that, we are still generating positive cash. So in light of that, it doesnt make sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.”\nThe offering met the high end of Tesla’s expectations with underwriters rushing to purchase an additional $300 million worth of shares. Musk himself purchased $10 million worth of shares on Valentine’s Day. The offering, which closed on February 19, 2020, raised net proceeds of $2.31 billion, the company said in a filing with the SEC. Tesla has said that the net proceeds will be used to “further strengthen its balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes.”\nWall Street is highly divided on Tesla. Out of a group of 47 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, only 7 have buy ratings. Yet Tesla stock’s joyride continues, more than doubling since the beginning of the year—and it’s only February. Tesla’s market capitalization hit $100 billion in late January and is currently at $165 billion—a rich 6.7 times the company’s $24.6 billion in 2019 revenue. If Musk can sustain this $100 billion-plus market cap, he’s in for a $346 million payday tied to the stock’s performance.\nMORE FOR YOU\n', 'TSLA', '2020-02-21'),

The next best-selling model that year was the Chevrolet\nBolt, which sold a mere 16,000.\nThe success of both Tesla cars, and Tesla shares, have baffled many in the automotive industry, who point to the companys small size; precarious financial history; and repeated struggles with manufacturing delays; and customer complaints about long waits for orders and difficulty obtaining parts and service.\nMeanwhile established automakers with brands that play at practically every price point and in every segment have been promising and slowly releasing their own stabs at a viable electric vehicle. But none have so far proven to be Tesla killers.\nA slew of new models are scheduled for release starting in early 2020, and many are starting to offer specs competitive with what buyers can find on Tesla models. For example, Fords\nMach-E Mustang electric crossover promises 300 miles of range in one configuration, close to the 322 miles on the long range version of the Model 3 sedan.\nBut relatively few buyers in the United States seem interested in battery electrics, and industry watchers think many buyers are early adopters buying Teslas out of an interest in the brand or an interest in cutting edge technology, rather than out of an interest in owning an electric car.\n', 'TSLA', '2020-02-23'),

Gobs of torque and all-wheel-drive grip mean it can burst out of a stop and hit law-breaking speeds in no time. But if theres one car that can match the Model 3s explosive acceleration, its the new Audi RS 6 Avant .\nThe RS 6 is new and improved for 2020, with a twin-turbo V-8 making 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, combined with a mild-hybrid system. It sends power to all four wheels via Audis famous Quattro all-wheel-drive system, enough to rocket the car to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds. Interestingly, thats slower than the Model 3s 0-60 of 3.3 seconds. The Lovecars YouTube channel, hosted by Tiff Needell and Paul Woodman, wanted to see how they stacked up head-to-head in a good old fashioned drag race.\nThe Model 3, despite its zero-rpm torque punch, is only able to hold onto the RS 6 for a few yards before falling behind. The RS 6 is just too powerful for it to keep up—fair, considering it costs around twice as much. So while the Tesla can sprint to 60 mph quicker, its not the winner this time.\nNow we just have to see how well the RS 6 can do against the big daddy Model S Performance .\nThis content is imported from poll.

He believes, “If somebody graduated from a great university, that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things, but it’s not necessarily the case. If you look at, say, people like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, these guys didn’t graduate from college, but if you had a chance to hire them, of course that would be a good idea.” Musk once tweeted, “A PhD is definitely not required,” and followed that statement up by saying, “Don’t care if you even graduated high school.”\nMusk seeks out individuals who demonstrate “ evidence of exceptional ability . And if there is a track record of exceptional achievement, then it is likely that that will continue into the future.”\nAccording to the handbook, trust is mission critical. The company offers its employees its full faith and trust and provides them with important responsibilities. Its believed that people who are imbued with respect and trust will rise up to the challenge and maintain the highest degree of professionalism.\nThe most important thing, according to the handbook, is that its everyone’s job to help make the company successful. Each employee needs to act as if they are owners. This means that if they have a good idea on how things can be done differently or better, they should share it with the appropriate managers. Employees are free to go up the chain of command, including Musk himself, if they believe that they have something of value to offer. This edict empowers everyone to take ownership of their job, career and the future of Tesla.\nOne of the rules in the handbook is all about having fun at work. Employees are encouraged to make new friends, strive to be the best that they can be and take on new and exciting challenges. The company wants everyone to work hard, love what they do and enjoy themselves.\nThe forthright tone of the handbook is refreshing. You can almost hear Musk’s voice behind the manual’s admonishment that arriving to work late every Monday morning because you stayed up late watching football is inexcusable because there are people depending on you. “Traffic accidents happen, we get that, but they don’t happen every Monday during football season.”\nThere is an understanding that if you’re sick, you stay home. “Don’t get the rest of us sick,” the handbook states.\n“Our assumption will be that if you don’t call and don’t show up for work, you’re a jerk.”\nIronically, some of the company’s requirements have been slightly—and at times flagrantly—ignored by Musk himself. Over the years, he has transgressed some of Tesla’s own principles. This includes calling a scuba diving expert who was rescuing children from a cave in Thailand a “ pedo ,” a remark that landed him in court for defamation. (The jury ultimately ruled in Musk’s favor .) To be fair, its not clear about name-calling in the handbook.\nWhen the company was undergoing some difficult times, Musk claimed that he had buyers secured for the company at $420 per share, which was a substantial premium from where the stock price traded at that time. It was believed that he slightly exaggerated about the mysterious buyer. Some claim that he completely made up the story about the fictitious buyer. The stock price now trades at about $800 per share, so the critics have somewhat relented.\nMusk drew attention when he drank whiskey and smoked pot on the popular Joe Rogan podcast, which was watched and listened to by millions of people. His antics were questioned by corporate ethics experts.\nThere is a contingency of short-sellers on Twitter that maintain Musk is a modern day P.T. Barnum who overhypes his company and its stock price. They contend that Tesla shares are valued higher than several of the largest automakers combined and that the price can’t possibly remain at that premium and will ultimately crash. They allege that Tesla vehicle accidents, spontaneous fires and fatalities are caused by software that hasn’t been perfected yet.\nMusk allegedly hired investigators to hack an employee’s phone, spied on his messages and misled police about a potential mass shooting, according to Sean Gouthro, a former security manager at the company’s Nevada Gigafactory. Musk  claimed in an email that an employee attempted to engage in “damaging sabotage to our operations,” and accused “Wall Street short-sellers,” “oil & gas companies” or “the multitude of big gas/diesel car company competitors” may have been behind the activities.\nWhile the handbook calls for safety and the company wants “you to go home every day in the same condition you arrived,” there have been allegations of violations of safety .   Employees reportedly called 911 regularly, citing dangerous working conditions, such as “head injuries from unsecured construction debris blowing off the roof in a windstorm and people falling through holes in the floor.”\nTesla and Musk are an anomaly in the business world. Many loyal customers and investors love the company and its flamboyant CEO, who also exhibits humility at times. They steadfastly stand by Tesla and root for its continued success.\nTheir faith remains unshaken despite the many times its founder steps out of bounds. The handbook should probably contain a passage that permits Musk to partake in questionable behaviors as long as he keeps growing the company, increasing the value of Tesla for its shareholders and offers a great product for their customers.\nTesla’s human resources staff, corporate attorneys and board of directors will continue to have headaches and never-ending work to do in keeping up with their larger-than-life CEO.\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

The electric car company is currently in the process of clearing 92 hectares of forest in Gruenheide, east of Berlin, where it hopes to build its first European Gigafactory.\nTesla announced plans for Gigafactory 4 last November , but has not yet been granted official planning permission for the factory itself. However, Germany’s environment ministry told the company it could start preparing the site in advance “at its own risk,” according to BBC News . Local activist group Gruene Liga Brandenburg (Green League of Brandenburg) subsequently complained about the work, citing environmental concerns.\n“It should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding”\nSince Tesla was due to complete its tree-felling in just three more days, the court told the car company to temporarily stop the work so that the environmentalist group’s objections could be considered. “It should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding,” the court said in a statement justifying the stoppage, according to Reuters. Further court hearings are expected to take place this week.\nReuters notes that hundreds of demonstrators have protested over the factory and its impact on the environment. However lawmakers from two Germany political parties, the Christian Democrat and Free Democrat parties fear that the legal battles resulting from these environmental complaints could harm Germany’s pro-business credentials. Tesla is not the only large company to have faced difficulties in the country. Back in 2018, Google abandoned plans to launch a start-up incubator in Berlin’s Kreuzberg neighborhood after locals protested the impending corporate gentrification.\nIn total, Tesla has bought almost 300 hectares for its German factory, which it hopes to open in 2021. Eventually it wants the factory to produce as many as 500,000 cars annually, and employ 12,000 people. The company has said it will relocate colonies of forest ants, reptiles, and bats that will be affected by its work, notes BBC News, citing local media reports. In January, authorities found and diffused seven WWII bombs on the site as part of Tesla’s construction preparation.\nThe company’s CEO Elon Musk has also defended the factory’s impact on the environment. In a series of tweets, Musk claimed that the Gigafactory 4 won’t use much water on a daily basis, and that the forest being cleared is “not a natural forest” (it was planted for a cardboard factory ) and that only a small part will be used for the Gigafactory. “Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy, so net environmental impact will be extremely positive!” the CEO tweeted .\nTesla’s Berlin Gigafactory will be its fourth worldwide, following the construction of Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, China, which last year delivered its first cars just under a year after work at the factory began. Tesla’s first two Gigafactories are in the US in Nevada and Buffalo, New York.\n', 'TSLA', '2020-02-17'),

Here’s a look at the evolution of Tesla’s UI that we released just over a year ago, pictured above.\nMore recently, some owners refused new software updates after Tesla issued an update that limited range and Supercharging in some older Model S vehicles “in order to protect the battery pack.”\nNow it looks like those Tesla owners who have been resisting new software updates might not have much of a choice to accept them anymore.\nSeveral Tesla owners with vehicles on older software versions are reporting having received the following in-car message from Tesla:\nThe Tesla network is undergoing enhancements for increased security. In order to maintain compatibility with and access to connected vehicle features, this vehicle requires a software update to at least version 2019.40.2.3. If not updated prior to 1-May-2020, this vehicle may no longer be able to receive over-the-air software updates, access the Tesla Mobile App & associated features, utilize voice commands, receive streaming media content, and other connectivity dependent features may be impacted. Please install the available software update by selecting the yellow clock icon and choosing a convenient time. If you are persistently experiencing software update installation failures, please schedule a service appointment via Tesla Mobile App.\nTesla didn’t elaborate on what security enhancements they are making with this update.\nMany of the features that Tesla claims would be deactivated if they don’t update are considered essential in the Tesla ownership experience.\nElectrek’s Take\nAside from the weird, previously mentioned software update that limited range and Supercharging with only a vague “safety” reason from Tesla, which I still hope they are fixing, I really don’t think there’s a good reason not to accept new software updates.\nI know that many people were upset about the Autopilot nerfing, but I think it did enhance safety to a certain degree.\nWhat do you think? Are there any other legitimate reasons not to update? Let us know in the comment section below.\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The researchers fooled the car’s Mobileye EyeQ3 camera system by subtly altering a speed limit sign on the side of a road in a way that a person driving by would almost never notice.\nThis demonstration from the cybersecurity firm McAfee is the latest indication that adversarial machine learning can potentially wreck autonomous driving systems, presenting a security challenge to those hoping to commercialize the technology.\nMobileye EyeQ3 camera systems read speed limit signs and feed that information into autonomous driving features like Tesla’s automatic cruise control, said Steve Povolny and Shivangee Trivedi from McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team.\nThe researchers stuck a tiny and nearly imperceptible sticker on a speed limit sign. The camera read the sign as 85 instead of 35, and in testing, both the 2016 Tesla Model X and that year’s Model S sped up 50 miles per hour.\nThe modified speed limit sign reads as 85 on the Teslas heads-up display. A Mobileye spokesperson downplayed the research by suggesting this sign would fool a human into reading 85 as well.\nMcAfee\nThis is the latest in an increasing mountain of research showing how machine-learning systems can be attacked and fooled in life-threatening situations.\nIn an 18-month-long research process, Trivedi and Povolny replicated and expanded upon a host of adversarial machine-learning attacks including a study from UC Berkeley professor Dawn Song that used stickers to trick a self-driving car into believing a stop sign was a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit sign. Last year, hackers tricked a Tesla into veering into the wrong lane in traffic by placing stickers on the road in an adversarial attack meant to manipulate the car’s machine-learning algorithms.\n“Why we’re studying this in advance is because you have intelligent systems that at some point in the future are going to be doing tasks that are now handled by humans,” Povolny said. “If we are not very prescient about what the attacks are and very careful about how the systems are designed, you then have a rolling fleet of interconnected computers which are one of the most impactful and enticing attack surfaces out there.”\nAs autonomous systems proliferate, the issue extends to machine-learning algorithms far beyond vehicles: A March 2019 study showed medical machine-learning systems fooled into giving bad diagnoses.\nThe McAfee research was disclosed to both Tesla and Mobileye EyeQ3 last year. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from MIT Technology Review but did acknowledge McAfee’s findings and say the issues would not be fixed in that generation of hardware. A Mobileye spokesperson downplayed the research by suggesting that the modified sign would fool even a human into reading 85 instead of 35. The company doesnt consider tricking the camera to be an attack, and despite the role the camera plays in Tesla’s cruise control, it wasn’t designed for autonomous driving.\n“Autonomous vehicle technology will not rely on sensing alone, but will also be supported by various other technologies and data, such as crowdsourced mapping, to ensure the reliability of the information received from the camera sensors and offer more robust redundancies and safety,” the Mobileye spokesperson said in a statement.\nTesla has since moved to proprietary cameras on newer models, and Mobileye EyeQ3 has released several new versions of its cameras that in preliminary testing were not susceptible to this exact attack.\nThere are still a sizable number of Tesla cars operating with the vulnerable hardware, Povolny said. He pointed out that Teslas with the first version of hardware cannot be upgraded to newer hardware.\n“What we’re trying to do is were really trying to raise awareness for both consumers and vendors of the types of flaws that are possible,” Povolny said “We are not trying to spread fear and say that if you drive this car, it will accelerate into through a barrier, or to sensationalize it.”\nhide\n', 'TSLA', '2020-02-19'),
